It's more necessary than other champs which got way more skins that time. E.g. Annie got like 3 skins new meanwhile or Varus ( well he hadn't many) but he got 3 skins while nun got the lame TPA one ._.   . Even Soraka got 3 new skins in a row incoming ._, (although that was necessary too) He's such a great champ and i guess he should get one new :P there are so many possibilities for a new one. I (and maybe many others) would be looking forward to a new one ;3","replies":[{"poster":"IGayI Adl","date":"2015-03-16T17:38:05.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea yorick too :P would really be looking forward that skin http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=769430&d=1377809271","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veezey","date":"2015-03-15T16:03:10.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick maybe?","replies":[]}]}
