During that game my internet crashed. I restarted my router and was back in the game within 3 or 4 minutes. After 2 minutes my team won the game without me dealing a single damage up to that point. \r\nThe game was rated for me as a loss, even though i reconnected and noone issued a report.\r\nThe reason for this is, that a game, that you disconnect from for more than 90 secs is automatically rated a loss, due to riot support.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this system is not fair for those, who really have a disconnect.\r\nShouldn't the afk penelty system be at least take into account both, time off and reports?\r\nThat way it would be assured, that only ragequitters and leavers are hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Eroticat Nimar","date":"2020-01-14T04:08:29.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You Just gotta Take that one loss, it aint that big a deal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuiwara","date":"2020-01-13T21:27:22.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u dont know if u were reported or not.\neither way that afk system triggers without needing a report. i have dc sometimes too and sometimes i have to restart computer for reconnecting but well riot rules states that we have to keep our hardware in a state we can play ourself so in that way we cant complain. but it would be nice if the timer would allow a longer timeout from the game. when u realize u need a restart of the pc that countdown is really small and u most likely get an afk.","replies":[]}]}
