Ein diamond-adc wird vielleicht sagen, dass dr.mundo im late schwach ist, da er kiten kann. Ein bronze-adc versucht mundo im nahkampf zu besiegen und weint dann rum, dass mundo ein starker late-game champ ist. Ap-kogmaw skaliert anders als ad-kogmaw. Und ein jax wir die lane wahrscheinlich gegen einen yasuo gewinnen obwohl meiner meinung nach yasuo ein stärkerer early-game champ ist. Spiel einfach und du wirst ein gefühl dafür bekommen wie stark die champions sind.{{item:2054}}","replies":[]}]}
