And it&#039;s not a gentle sound but the scream of a bird.\r\nShe was playing with the &quot;Woad Scout Quinn&quot; skin, maybe that is the cause.\r\nEvery one in the team had the same experience.\r\nI ended up muting the game because of that. Getting your ears blasted by a bird every 10sec ain&#039;t the best.\r\nAnd playing muted is kinda hard.\r\n{{champion:133}} BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK (Quoting Valor)","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-03-18T23:01:56.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 dinge.\n1. das ist das wohl witzigste bug-report das ich lesen durfte\n2. ich w√ºrde empfehlen auf der deutschen forenseite deutsch zu schreiben...ich habs mal selbst erlebt dass Posts entfernt werden weil sie im falschem forum geposted wurden\n3. ich habs auch gemerkt, mehr und mehr soundbugs scheinen hochzukommen","replies":[]}]}
