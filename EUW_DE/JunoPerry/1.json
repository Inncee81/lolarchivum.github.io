How? With Paysafe.\nI had 3 PSC&#039;s (Paysafecards) here worth 10, 20 and 20&euro;. Now I live in Germany - so this might not affect you, but I couldn&#039;t get the RP.\nOf course I checked the guides on how to buy RP with PSC&#039;s and they all were showing I was allowed to combine cards.\nThe In-game shop told me I was not allowed to combine over 30&euro;. Even when I tried that it just told me that I can&#039;t purchase with 100&euro; until I have a Paysafe account. I was never even close to 100&euro; but it still popped up.\n\nI wrote to the Support and they told me that combining was disabled since 5.9.2012 in Germany.\nThat in fact means that RIOT is fooling people since 3 years. People that are trying to put money into LoL.\n\nIn the end I have both 20&euro; PSC&#039;s still lying around here. I cant pay with them.\nThe RP costs are ordered in wild numbers:\n5&euro; | 10&euro; | 25&euro; | 35&euro; | 50&euro; | 100&euro;\nFirst of all - you can&#039;t buy a 5&euro; PSC (only usable with a rest ammount of at least 5€ +).\n10&euro; works fine (but won&#039;t pay off in bonus RP - not worth).\n25&euro; is bullshit.\n35&euro; is the same.\n50&euro; works good as long as you just use a 50&euro; PSC I guess.\n100&euro; needs an account at Paysafe to function.\n\nNow whats up with the 5&euro; things? You can&#039;t buy them. I am able to get following PSC&#039;s:\n10&euro; | 15&euro; | 20&euro; | 30&euro; | 40&euro; | 50&euro; | 100&euro;\n(I&#039;m NOT sure about the 40&euro; one!)\n\nIn the end im able to get RP for 10, 50 or 100&euro;. Now why don&#039;t I just do that then? Because I already had one PSC. I figured if I check out what the guides say, as well as the internet I might be able to combine it. Everything said I was allowed to use multiple PSC&#039;s for one RP Purchase.\nOf course I wasted money and am now pissed off about it and didn&#039;t get to the RP that I wanted.\n\nThis post is mainly requesting a IMMEDIATE REWORK OF THE PAYMENT GUIDES!!\nIf you want someone to invest into your game - don&#039;t block them from that (You won&#039;t get paid otherwise).\n\nSO PLEASE RIOT: FIX THE PAYMENT GUIDES AND ENABLE THE SMOOTH NUMBERS FOR PAYSAFE!\nAlso maybe check if the other methods are affected by anything like that and rework that too!\nThis is just making people pissed off at the game they wanted to pay something for and I doubt that RIOT really wants this situation.\n\nCheers!\nJunoPerry\n\nPS: Sorry if I missspelled stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"They Fear Shaco","date":"2015-08-23T11:13:10.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you buy a 10€ PaySafeCard, you can buy 2x5€.
