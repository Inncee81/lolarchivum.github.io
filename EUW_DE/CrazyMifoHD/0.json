And not only her ultimate her other attacks just deal too much damage. That's why i think she's OP.","replies":[{"poster":"9DragonKids","date":"2015-02-08T15:46:46.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unlike other assasins, kata cant 100to0 u without her ult, even more so since dfg is gone. if you have any mobility or cc, her ult wont fully hit you. she always needs a teammate to kill you so i think shes less annoying than other assasins that hide in a brush and kill you if you walk past","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boksel","date":"2015-02-06T18:14:11.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hue . ok lets start.\nIm a Katarina main since season 2 and i need to say katarina is strong but NOT Op u can stop her \"all ins\" with every shitty CC and she is squischie if you know hot to focus a champion you can win every Game against her . Ofc a decent katarina player is waiting for a good engage but even that can be stoped by warding . just pick someting off-tank high cc vs her and its a 4o5 and free win :)","replies":[]}]}
