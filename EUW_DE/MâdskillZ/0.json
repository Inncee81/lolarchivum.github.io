Even by the standards of his father’s teachings, Zelos prowess far outshone all others. Knowing his potential, his father began to secretly teach him the Hiten-Mitsurugi Style. Due to the mysterious death of his father, his training never concluded and he was left with only two sword hilts. \n\n    For the impeding war with Noxians, one Ionian Elders ordered Zelos to seek reinforcements from Demaica. He and his crew immediately dispatched for Demacia, but on his way there, he was ambushed by Noxian Assassins and by the crew provided by the Elder. Although outnumbered, Zelos fought effortlessly and defeated them all.  He realized that that Elder who ordered this mission was a Noxian spy who wanted him dead. All of Ionia was in grave danger. Zelos quickly journeyed back  in secrecy determined to eradicate the spies in his country.\n\n Ionia was in the middle of a fierce battle with  the Noxians when he arrived.  He sought after the Elder who tried to have him killed. There, at the tip of the Placidium stood the Elder, shrouded in purple mist. Zelos immediately rushed to attack the Elder, but the strange mist has immobilized his body. He screamed in agony as the mist burned his entire being. At his dying breath, his swords glowed and absorbed the deadly mist from his body. There was dancing shards of purple steel in the form of a flame. Zelos could feel his soul connected with every fragment of the blade unleashed its turmoil. Blades dispersed into fragments swirling around Zelos and with his command, it bolted for the Elder and pierced him with the wind. Fallen, a purple mist raise from the Elder’s body and it laughed, “You Ionians will only transcend into doom, you have already been cursed!” Then dissipated into the sky  with the howling wind. \n\n    With his weapon awakened and his new found power, Zelos journey all over Valoran hoping to find and destroy the mist. His mission brought him to the Institute of War where he joined the League of Legends to find the purple mist responsible for the destruction of Ionia.\n\nZealos- The clouds are ever-changing, so must Ionia.\n\nOkay so this is just a really rough concept of how I imagined Zelos to be. I am not good with the League numbers, only the description. It might seem a bit OP, but I love to hear feed back from you guys :)\n\nPassive: Inner Turmoil\n\nFor every kill, his blade grows stronger gaining more passive abilities.\n\n\nQ- Doudle-Edged/ Disperse/ Reform\n\n\nDouble-Edge: Zelos swords connects becoming a double-edged sword dealing AOE\n\nDisperse: Zelos swords disperses into fragments and swirls around an enemy for a duration and dealing aoe to others around the shards\n\nReform: Zelos swords reforms back into a duel-wielding  giving him attack speed.\n\n\nW- Hiten-Mitzurugi Style\n\n\nHiten-Mizurugi Style: Passive: Each attack leaves a fragment on the enemy.
