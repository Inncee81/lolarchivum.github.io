This three are the biggest noob champs ingame. I want to nerve them and everybody who want that too, like the comment! Maybe it works and the LOL support cares about us.","replies":[{"poster":"TroIIed to Death","date":"2017-12-12T06:52:47.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"darius is in an extremely weak state right now.

His early is weak, he can't win a 1 v 1 without hitting his E and there are multiple midlaners like Kata or Zed who can just jump out of the cage, his W is useless without the Stun of his E, he has 0 Mobility, he is squishy and is just strong when his Ult is up, he gets fed and in lategame. Still he has a hard time against assasins and high range mages.\n\nAnd Darius...well, I don't know him that well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flumbro","date":"2017-12-10T00:11:53.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha. Du hast vor 11 Minuten gegen Teemo verloren. Du bist nur wütend, weil der/die Gegner besser war/en als du (und dein Team). Bitte denk drüber nach bevor du etwas postest.
