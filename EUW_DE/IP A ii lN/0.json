Player x decides to rage and picks ezreal with smite and ignite instead off going with a support.\r\n\r\nEven in games that do not have any trol picks, i believe that solo-Q can only reflect your skill level if you actually play the role that is your main. \r\nFor myself for example i am Gold IV right now. However eventhough my main is mid and i can compete easily with Platin/Diamond with my mid champs, i can barely use  that skill. Simply because i get my mid pick about 1 out off 5 games. And every other off those games i get a trol that is mad for me taking mid eventhough i am going with the pickorder.\r\n\r\nI believe this is one of the biggest and most annoying issues in Solo-Q and i believe there is a simple fix.\r\nIf every player who searches for the game would be able to select the role as which he wants to play and then the 5 fitting roles get matched up into one team, there would be no issues. Everyone would know what champs/positions to pick and would perform at their actual skill-level. \r\n\r\nNow i do not know if this has been suggested before, but if it has not i would really like Riot to consider this.\r\nAlso i am not sure if this is the right part off the forum for this post.","replies":[{"poster":"NG Drakuboy","date":"2015-08-13T15:15:15.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naja kommt aufs Wetter an","replies":[]},{"poster":"Approxima","date":"2015-08-13T15:29:21.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eigentlich eine gute Idee, aber echt nur notwendig f√ºr Bronze.
