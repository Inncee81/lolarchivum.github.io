If there was a biger price difference I would understand it but at this point either 975 RP or a additional Voiceover!\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"CealumZ","date":"2015-04-02T12:23:24.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've bought this skin too... Well its a bummer that there is no voiceover...
