There was a time when I used to main Zed but with his buffs he was obverplayed and I kinda lost my fun in him. So I started to Jungle. Now I have 6300 IP and need a Jungler with the following qualities (There is no jungler with all of them and so just make suggestions):\r\n- Dash, best if related to area not enemy or ally\r\n- CC (Best stun or knockback)\r\n- Outplay\r\n- Manaless\r\n- OK clear\r\n- Not just currently OP but consistently strong\r\n- Some kind of AOE Damage for teamfights\r\n- Strong Lategame (This one is a bit more important)\r\nPlease just recommend, don&#039;t care if the champion matches all my criteria or not.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
