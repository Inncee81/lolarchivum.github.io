Plat V) - main Top/Adc - *http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/EUW/Syk%C3%AAs/summary*\n\n> littleRedskin (curr. Gold I) - main Mid/Jng - *http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/EUW/littleRedskin/summary*\n\nWe are looking for a 3rd member to play Twisted Treeline Rankeds. We alrdy had a Plat III TT Team last Season (Win rate 70%) but unfortunately our 3rd member quitted to play LoL.\nOur aim would definitly be to hit Diamond! This does not mean that it shouldn't be fun. We are both very active but we don't want to have fix days in which he have to play rankeds! We are both from Austria and our mother language is German but we also speak English quite well.\n- sry for writing mistakes tho :P\n___________________________\nFor the Team we are looking for a Jungler or (if we play supp-meta) for a Support. You should be min. Gold I in SoloQ and it would also be nice if you alrdy have TT experience. Also you shouldn't be too serious ;3\n\n**P.s.** \nWe would also join other teams if you are searching for players either!\n\nIf you have further questions, just add me or write comments below!\n**IGN: Sykês**","replies":[{"poster":"Sykês","date":"2015-03-17T19:33:50.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rly don't get why anyone would ubvote that post.
