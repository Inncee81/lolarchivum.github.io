The only dumb thing is her Ultimate that force her to go into Meleerange as Squishy. Also her Passive trigger mostly randomly. \n\nThey should just change the Ultimate into a Cd of 0.5 sec without the AoE execute so she can Kite with Valor. Her Ultimate is now her W that will stack like Statikk Shiv but slower when she moves. On 100 Stacks she can use it. \nAlso her Passive could be triggered with 3 Stacks on the same Enemy, dealing +max health damage of the enemy","replies":[{"poster":"Biji kus","date":"2015-07-09T13:45:42.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, when i think about your right and taht would be a perfekt rework ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caleber","date":"2015-11-08T17:17:31.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do NOT rework Quinn, she is perfect the way she is now.
