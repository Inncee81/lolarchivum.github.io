An assassins dream. But at the moment Eve is almost completly useless, she dosen&#039;t fit in any role. Can&#039;t really do anything constantly if not","url":"http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-en/tU7gwLcW-evelynn-needs-a-rework","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since {{champion:28}}  seems to be reworked for the assassin update, i wanted to make a suggestion. Read the link to get an idea of why Evelynn needs or may not need a rework also google (Evelynn rework) to get more opinions on this topic. I am suggesting a buff. \r\n\r\nThe suggestion:\r\nAdd a new trait to her passive, making her a true stalker. Meaning adding a second ring that has a slightly bigger radius than her stealth ring. Targets between the to rings are stalked. If they are stalked for a period of time Evelynn will gain increased damage against these champions. Either a percentage damage or a scaling damage. \r\nStalking would between 2-5 seconds and give her between 5-20 percent extra damage to the target. \r\n\r\nWhy am i suggesting this?\r\nI love Evelynn, but she feels weak compered to other assassins. Rengar Khazix Shaco. These three Champions also have stealth and in my opinion can utilize it better due to them having more damage for single targets  and or more damage overall. However these champions do not have the best passive in game. Evelynn can truly stalk enemy champions and if a Eveylnn is able to stalk, for the new passive stalking to be activated, an enemy champion should be punished for it. Evelynn should be able to kill enemy assassins if she has them targeted with her new passive. \r\nEvelynn is limited to her allies in a way that they have to soften up targets to truly assassinate them. These changes could give Evelynn play making potential. \r\nFrom the lore this change this change would make sense since Evelynn is said to stalk her targets. \r\n\r\nPLease dont be to hard on me.","replies":[{"poster":"Sincetia","date":"2016-07-31T23:16:50.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also ich habe vor ein bis zwei Wochen angefangen Eve öfter zu spielen, will sie sogar mainen da sie mir extrem viel Spaß macht.\nIch weiß nicht viel über sie (Decisionmaking...) aber sie ist durchaus stark auch wenn sie in low elo kaum soloq carrypotential hat da man aufgeschmissen ist sobald man 2 oder mehr Tanks oder OFF-TANKS im Gegnerteam hat.\nAber ich denke sie hat durchaus Potenzial in bestimmten Matchups sie ist halt einer der schwierigeren Champs und eine Änderung wie die oben genannte würde sie sicherlich einfacher machen.\n\nDie Frage ist wollen wir Eve Spieler das???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bluefersan","date":"2016-07-31T20:45:02.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"warum schreibst du englisch in einem deutschen board?\naußerdem ist eve stark genug, wenn du dir einige challanger games angeschaut hast.","replies":[]}]}
