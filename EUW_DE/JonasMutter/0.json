At that time, we believed we would have a fix soon, but after several attempts to restore the daily RP grants, we haven't been able to make significant progress. Because RP is actually money, it's controlled by a transactional accounting system which doesn't allow mass updates. \n> \n> To ensure PBE testers have access to BE, we'll be permanently adding a mission called \"PBE Blue Essence Bonus\"; starting December 19, 2018 at 5:00 PM PST. This mission will grant 50 BE for playing one game on PBE, and will have a 4 hour cool down. \n> \n> We've also adjusted content pricing to support these changes. The following content will be available for 1 BE in PBE:\n> \n> * All champions\n> * All upcoming and recently released skins\n> * All skins for champions getting a champion update\n\n\nGruß Yatsuki","replies":[]}]}
