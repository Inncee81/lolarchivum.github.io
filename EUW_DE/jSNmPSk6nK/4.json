Dein Argument, dass viele Spieler damals noch nicht gespielt haben ist komplett unsinnig, da dir ja dann theoretisch auch 1 000 000 ip zustehen würden, da es ja auch Spieler gibt die diese besitzen. Zudem wurde der skin auf ebay mit 300euro+ gehandelt. Genau wie die PAX Skins ist es ein Sammlerstück, welches langjährige Mitglieder des Spiels belohnen soll.","replies":[]}]}
