We are not going to be the most tryhard team in the sense that we dont:\n\n- have fixed playing times (we just play when everyone has time, neeeeeerds)\n\n- fixed tournament days\n\n\nBut we are very focused on improving as a team (even more than on winning) in terms of playing certain compositions, executing a game plan and communication. You should be able to step outside of your comfort zone, e.g. by playing a champion you dont have much practice on but it&#039;s necessary for the team comp (feeding allowed). You should also not be one-tricking a champion.\n\n\n\n\nPosition|Taken|Solo/Duo|Flex\n\nTop|-|-|\n\nJungle|X|Plat3|Gold3\n\nMid|X|Plat4|Gold1\n\nBot|-|-|\n\nSupport|-|-|\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: Jan 2nd\n\n\n\nWe are looking preferably for a duo botlane because there (should) be already some synergy.\n\nPlease dont be that guy that plays one game with us and then never again :)\n\n\n\nIGN: Midlane Moshpit\n\n\n\nEdit: Teamspeak3 is a requirement","replies":[]}
