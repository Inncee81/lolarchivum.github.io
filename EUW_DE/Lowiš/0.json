Because i would really love to show my main Champion with a cool looking icon.\r\nThank you for taking some time and reading this you can post some other icon ideas down below if you have any i would love to see some cool concepts.\r\nHave a good one \r\nOneTr&iacute;ckBard{{champion:432}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kind Prow","date":"2017-08-12T18:44:38.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there an icon for poppy?
