He will start with one item that he can change into another everytime he wants because it costs no gold. So you have to decide if you take the first form that deals more damage then the second form, or the second form which has more utility then the first. With the idea of the champion i thought about a support champion that can support his adc with his high utility or a support that sets his focus on the enemy team and deal not over powered high damage but enough to be able to decide a teamfight. The Champion brings a lot of posibilities with his kit and a very interesting play style that makes the role of the support a lot more interesting.\r\n\r\nLore:\r\nLira and Mero live a friendly life at a quiet place near the Mount Targon. Every evening they go to the highest mountain, to see the stars in the beautiful dark sky. The stars are an undescribeable binding they have to each other but they never knew why. The only thing they know is that they found each other, because they saw a very bright shining star that they both wanted to see from the Mount Targon. On these mountains they met each other and decided to find out what this star is about and why they both feel connected to it. One day a wounded demacian Warrior tries to get safety in the house of Lira and Mero so they allow him to stay in their house. However the next day, Noxians surround their house and want to kill the Warrior. Mero tries to protect him and his house but the Noxians start to burn down and invade the house. Right in this moment Lira and Mero felt something that they never felt in the last years anymore. They both look up and see the extremely bright star again. In the next moment it was like the time stopped and nothing could move anymore. Then Lira and Mero feel a strength they never had before. In the moment the time went further the Noxians were afraid and escaped. However Lira and Mero were able to safe the Warrior,but their house was completely burnt down. Mero got angry and started searching the Noxians to punish them for the things that they&#039;ve done. Lira was afraid and said him to let them go but Mero didn&#039;t listen to her. Lira wants to protect the Warrior further more and wasn&#039;t able to follow Mero. After a few years Mero finally came back. Lira and Mero were both happy to see each other again and the bright star appears once more. However Mero wasn&#039;t the same.
