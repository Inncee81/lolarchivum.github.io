I played with him a few days ago and because people in the game were speculating if he was using a script I started to investigate. It seems that he is playing Kog&#039;Maw and Xerath and that he plays in a very strange style. He is able to perfectly Orb-walk with Kog&#039;Maw with 3-4 Attack speed and has an incredible winrate overall. I would be happy if you could investigate a bit further and ban him if he really is scripting.\r\n\r\nHis op.gg profile link: [http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=benouille](http://http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=benouille)\r\n\r\nI do fully understand that I could be wrong and that this player is a professional player smurfing on this account, but his champion pool is very similar to a lot of confirmed former scripters.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, and it would mean the world to me if you could respond with any feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"TerrorRaven","date":"2016-06-05T12:36:03.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
