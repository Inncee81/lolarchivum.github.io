Here's Bubobubo with more:\n\"TL;DR: We’re updating how our sales work for the first few months of the new year. \nIn 2019, we’re revamping our sales. First up, we’ll be focusing on more favorites like Your Shop, event passes, and the Essence Emporium. Next, we’ll be experimenting with weekly sales over the next few months. \nOverall, the total amount of content going on sale will go up. You’ll see the balance shift towards newer and higher quality skins, but we’ll still look to keep a healthy presence of champions and classics in the mix. There will also be some weeks that look pretty different from what you’ve seen before. \nSome features of the new weekly sales we’re testing:\nEvery Monday at noon PT, there will be at least 20 items on sale in the store\nWe’ll feature sales in the store front page below “Popular items” instead of in sale schedule announcements (see our refund policy here)\nEverything eligible for weekly sales, early sales, or essence emporiums could be included in a sale\nWe’ll have at least two dedicated essence emporiums a year\nMonthly bundles will be cut from the rotation\nWe haven’t changed these sales in a long time, so we’ll keep a close eye on feedback as we go!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lotus Angel","date":"2019-11-03T08:15:37.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx","replies":[]}]}]}
