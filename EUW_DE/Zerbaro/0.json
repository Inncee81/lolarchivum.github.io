A broom as weapon and maybe even a cape with something stupid on it.\r\n\r\nAnimationwise it should have the least amount of beauty possible, meaning when he dashes he does so as a 2D model just dashing without any character movement in a weird pose (like in Super Mario when you jump) and a whirlwind with a not really fluent twist. Let him say something stupid when he ults on someone, instead of &quot;Sorye / Igei Ton / Sorye Ge Ton&quot;.\r\n\r\nWe all know how tilting it is to play against him, but with a skin like this the tilt would get to a whole new level!\r\n\r\nThis &#039;Tilting&#039; skin can also be transferred over to other beloved champions, such as Teemo, Singed, Zed etc... you know, all these champions you love to lane and play against\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this idea? I know Rito will never even consider to do this but this would be the only playable Yasuo skin imo.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒäker","date":"2017-10-05T08:34:15.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"German Forum","replies":[]}]}
