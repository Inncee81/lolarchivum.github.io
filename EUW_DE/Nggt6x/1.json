Wanted to play a game and I see on Draft pick: Must own 16 Champions or more. I think this is pretty stupid considering the free Champion rotation. I can tell what they are trying to do but why 16? 16 seem abit much! For newer players Draft pick is something very good. And now you have to buy  16 champions to play a league Draft game?\r\nI myself I found my self a Champion I like to main + I bought champions for every single lane for Draft pick, just that if i dont get my lane that i wanted.\r\nLower it please! I myself I never had a problem with someone not having the champ for that specific lane and have noone struggle with it.\r\nPeople acctualy dont seem to upset when they dont get to play the champion the want to play. People are willing to play new champions and thats even good for the game. I dont see the point of having 16, make it 8 or 10 but not 16\r\n\r\n**_Thank you for reading this. I dont think Riot will respond to this but its good that it gets some attention!_**\r\n\r\n**_~~feel free to giv meh som rp or summorner icon,i need it pl0x~~_**","replies":[{"poster":"Good Guy Putin","date":"2016-12-16T14:53:23.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need 16 because: 6 bans and 10 players = 16 Champions\nIf you have less than 16 Champions, there is a chance that all of your champions are picked or banned. \nsry for bad english","replies":[]},{"poster":"IceColdFire","date":"2016-12-16T14:19:08.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the german forum","replies":[]}]}
