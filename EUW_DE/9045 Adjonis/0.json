After reaching unstoppable I bought it again but only had 0 stacks, I didn&#039;t care much because i thought it works like GA(cd does still exist with rebuy) and i only have the stacks i had befoe, so i would have lost only 2 .\r\nWhen i picked it up with Fiora {{champion:114}} and was Legendary with 20 stacks, I got shut down by leo{{champion:89}}  and lost NINETEEN stacks with one death. thats 95 ad I lost bc of one death, eventough i should have only lost 10 stacks (45 ad).( lost about 1.5k gold in ad {{item:1038}} ) At first, I tought it was a visiual bug, but after seeing my ad I realized it was no visiual bug and after a kill i had only 3 instead of my 12 I should have had.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be not every time, because nearly everytime I died,I lost the regular amount of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know how you wanna recreate it, except of buying it playing these two champs and see what will happen...\r\n\r\n I hope u fix it soon :)","replies":[{"poster":"YouStoleMyName","date":"2015-05-21T15:43:28.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. German forum.\n2. How often u died after u sold ur Occult ? \n\nIt still counts after u bought it 1 Time. E.g. U sell it on 10 Stacks, losing half on every dead, u die now 2 Times. 10 ( dead ) - 5 stacks - another Dead 2 Stacks.\nAnd if u die more often it will count into the negative one until u are balanced on Kill / Death.\n\nIts not a bug. If u just could sell it if u reach 0 Stacks and rebuy it, to get 5 stacks again, it were a abuse on a Item.","replies":[]}]}
