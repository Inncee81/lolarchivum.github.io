Me being ranked Bronze 3 (true elo most likely correct since I play very bad atm but maybe it's like high bronze or low silver since i didn't care much about ranked last season) gets matched with or against silvers (okay, i can get that), golds (maybe I'm better elo than I thought?), Plats, Diamonds and sometimes Masters and Grandmasters. Some games ago I was matched against Mystiques (some former LEC player or something it seems, I'm not to sure about that).\r\n \r\nImportant: These matches are NOT ranked, but normal Draft picks. I don't know if that makes any difference.\r\n\r\nSo, my questions are: Is that normal? Is it a mess because it's still pre-season? Is matchmaking for normals just like that?\r\n\r\nAny answers are welcome.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Allerbester Biss","date":"2019-12-31T14:53:31.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deutsches Forum und in Normals hast du eine andere MMR als im Ranked...\nDeswegen kannst du da gegen jeden möglichen Gegner spielen!","replies":[{"poster":"Pschorn","date":"2019-12-31T15:32:25.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ups, merk ich mir fürs nächste mal.
