You must have given the team the required fifteen (15) minutes from match start time to substitute their ineligible player(s). If the ineligible player shows up between maps/rounds, you must give the team the required ten (10) minutes to replace their ineligible player. If the team does not substitute their ineligible player, do not start the match or allow the match to be started.\r\n\r\nPickups\r\nTeams are not permitted to use a pickup at any point in a match. A pickup is defined as someone who is not listed on the Match Fixture page.\r\n\r\nGame IDs\r\nAll Game IDs on a team&rsquo;s roster must be valid.
