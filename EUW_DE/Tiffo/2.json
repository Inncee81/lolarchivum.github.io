Es zählt als Niederlage, wird aber nicht mit bewertet. Es nimmt dir quasi nur 1 Placementgame.\nSind dann nicht mehr 10 die gewertet werden sondern 9.\nHier die Erklärung des Riot Supports:\n\"Games that are Loss Prevented normally do not count against your record, as they are essentially \"forgiven\" matches. However, there is one exception: Placement Matches. If you get a Loss Prevented during a placement match, it will not count against you, but it will count as a game towards your 10 total games. Let us say that you were on your 10th placement match and you were 5-4. If you got a Loss Prevented for your placement match, it does not count towards your wins or losses, and does not harm your hidden MMR at all. However, even though you are only at 5-4 (a total of 9 games), you will be immediately placed into a tier and division, as it took a slot of your 10 Placement matches.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Royal l3lue","date":"2016-01-20T14:25:03.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eigentlich nicht. aber bei mir auf dem Profil steht auch  1 win 1 lose. der eine lose war das verhinderte Niederlage game","replies":[]}]}
