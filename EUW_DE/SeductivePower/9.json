They benefit from almost everything.\r\n\r\nAP non-mana Champs however are. You can&#039;t really switch between builds, because almost all good AP items (dmg and utility) have mana or something to do with mana. So it&#039;s not worth buying Morellonomicon on Akali for example, although the items offers some good utility and stats, but Akali along with others doesn&#039;t profit buying these items.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to add new items specifiacally for such champs - to add more variety when it comes to building and utility as well. Adding some counter items to already existing mana heavy/benefiting ones so that these champs also get something.","replies":[{"poster":"Kata Ga Kill","date":"2016-11-25T16:03:27.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see it like you.\n\n{{champion:55}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:8}} have the most Problems that their Start Items are not so efficent like others.\n\nAlso the lack of others ADC Items besides from AS-Crit. \nAD Caster like Jhin, Lucian and MF needs more Pure AD Crit Items thats works with ER/IE or \nBattle ADC's with Lifesteal-AS-Hurican based Stats like Kalista, Kindred have also Problems in their Build.\n\nOr the Lack of AS based Brusiers like Shyvana, Xin, Jax, Aatrox who need also HP stats as well.\nOr Hybrid Users, are poorly too.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Ga Kill","date":"2016-11-25T16:07:22.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beide starten auf Dark Seal wenn man damit klar kommt :v)\n\n\nAka{{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kata Ga Kill","date":"2016-11-25T16:11:38.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali Ga Kill,realm=EUW,application-id=Wj1wcocU,discussion-id=9QEou521,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-11-25T16:07:22.608+0000)\n>\n> Beide starten auf Dark Seal wenn man damit klar kommt :v)\n> \n> \n> Aka{{champion:84}}\n\nMan startet immer mit Dark Seal, das Problem ist aber wie ich gesagt habe die effizienz ist Käse.\nUngefähr 100 Gold sind bei dem Item verschwendetes Gold wegen dem Mana in den Stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Ga Kill","date":"2016-11-25T16:14:31.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nicht unbedingt bei beiden gibt es 4 Optionen:\n\n\nBoots 4 Pots \n\nCloth 5 Pots\n\nDark Seal 3 Pots\n\nLongsword 3 Pots\n\n\nDas sind die die Sinn machen\n\nAka{{champion:84}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OT Riku","date":"2016-11-25T15:59:26.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deutsches Forum.","replies":[]}]}
