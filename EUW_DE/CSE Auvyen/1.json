You want to compete in competitions and are looking for suitable people? That's possible with the right platform.\r\n\r\nYou will be accompanied by the management, which will take care of tasks such as register teams, enter ESL, etc. There is also an extensive forum to exchange ideas, to organize scrims with other teams or to participate in internal events.\r\n\r\nThe team is completely rebuilt, so that everyone has the chance to become captain of the team. We are looking for Top, JGL, MID, ADC and SUP. You have been gold or higher and at least 16 years old. You should have at least 2 days a week to work out. This is absolutely necessary to participate later in tournaments.\r\n\r\nDid I spark your interest? Then write me on nebelkoma@gmail.com.","replies":[]}
