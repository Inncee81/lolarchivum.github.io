I speak English and German. \r\n\r\nI am currently Plat 3, i can play every lane if needed but preffer playing on Midlane or in Jungle.  Well yes im not diamond, but it doesnt mean im bad. Im sure i would do as good as a diamond 4-5 player would do in a 5vs5 team. So if somone there looks out for dia players, give me chanz to prove that i am good enough.","replies":[]}
