No other role is guaranteed to be availabe to you. Only if you filled the last game or played support you are guaranteed to get any of the roles you want. Else you simply have to adapt. It seems simply that whenever you play there's too many other people wanting to play top and mid for you to get the role, that happens. So there's nothing you can do other than either choose a role with less players or play at a time with less players to increase the chances to get the role you want.\nAlso, you WR has 0 impact on the role-selector, that is seperate from the Team/Opponent-Selector which are MMR-Dependent and thus are influenced by your WR. The Role-Selector simply takes the 10 players the MM give it and tries to give as many of them as possible one of the roles that they selected, you simply had some bad luck.","replies":[]}]}
