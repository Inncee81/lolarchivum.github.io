We have no idea how far/close we are to leveling. \n\n        Getting honor felt great at first but it almost feels like beating a dead horse trying to level without seeing how far/close we are. \n\nAntwort von Riot:    \n\n  Hey, this is a good question, but we actually very intentionally did not include any sort of progress indicator for Honor levels. Here are a few reasons why:  \n\n        We didn't want to anchor people on the \"grind\" to honor levels. By not having progress indicators, we wanted to root the reinforcement for being sportsmanlike on the feedback you get from other players (the honors), not any artificial motivation from being \"close to the next level\".\n        Our behind-the-scenes systems which determine honor level ups aren't simple. The types of calculations we do to determine if a player is ready to level up take into account their holistic behavior across many games, and don't lend themselves well to being surfaced in an \"XP bar\"-style system. Anything we surface here could also warp behavior around trying to \"minmax\" the most honor points, which really refocuses it away from the point of the Honor system - play good games and you'll make progress.\n        We wanted to have a few discrete levels in Honor, since bloating the number would make each feel less meaningful. However, we wanted players to progress over the course of a season or half-season, which means that progress to the next level would necessarily be fairly slow. We didn't think it would be a great experience to reinforce this through some progress indicator.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-07-03T18:05:03.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Es gibt keinen angezeigten Fortschritt, damit man einfach immer positiv ist.","replies":[]}]}
