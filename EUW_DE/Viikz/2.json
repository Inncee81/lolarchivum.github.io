To be honest - it&#039;s written in the topic.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a Team ( it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a new Team or Team with a huge mount of knowledge)\r\n\r\nLet me introduce myself :\r\n- I am 22 years old\r\n- living in Germany \r\n- playing LoL since Season 2 ( with a few breaks)\r\n- My highest rank was Gold in 2014\r\n- I think I can say , that I am a quiet person . I don&#039;t rage about  faults by my team - but sometimes i rage about my own mistakes , &#039;cause i think i am hella dumb! :D\r\n\r\nIn 2014 i carried myself from B to gold ( as Support ) \r\nThat&#039;s how it comes to my most played lanes : Mid / Support and ADC ( in this order)\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is since 2015 I am silver ranked.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested , add me Ingame. My Nickname is : Canikz \r\n\r\nSee u soon in Summoners Rift!{{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"Qbert","date":"2017-12-14T11:35:39.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warum postest du denn deinen englischen Thread im Deutschen Forum? :S\n\nWir verstehen dich auch in deiner Muttersprache!(sofern diese Deutsch ist)","replies":[{"poster":"Viikz","date":"2017-12-14T12:12:23.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh oups :D Ich bin das irgendwie gewohnt dass es international ist . sorry :)","replies":[]}]}]}
