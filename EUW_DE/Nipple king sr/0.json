My plan is, because the UK is a fat bag of cockfarts and  leaving the EU. Which means that my life might not be as comfortable as it is right now.\r\n\r\nSo my question(s) to people that live and work in Germany is thus:\r\n- How easy is it for a foreigner to find work in Germany?\r\n- Having a look at some sites catered for people in an IT background, there seems to be alot of software/application people. While I do dabble with SQL, my career is more focused on IT security/secure telecomms and infrastructure. Does anyone have any good sites looking for jobs within Germany??\r\n\r\nWhy do I want to do this? I love my life. I love the fact I have no family, no commitments, no desire to be responsible outside of working and a need to want to keep the life I have.\r\nI have found that through speaking to people outside of the UK or, people that do not have English as their primary language are generally nicer than those from English speaking countries.\r\nThey seem to have a want and a need to learn. They understand that an education is a tool for those that do not want to become ignorant, narrow minded and simply live in poverty. Although I don&#039;t speak to alot of people outside of the UK. Well, I don&#039;t really speak to alot of people inside the UK.\r\nThose that I have spoke to are pretty smart.\r\n\r\nPS - apologies if this is in the incorrect board.","replies":[{"poster":"Eibert Rümmel","date":"2017-05-09T21:58:17.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"gl&hf\n\nsry dont have a good link","replies":[]},{"poster":"Original Veigar","date":"2017-05-10T15:06:40.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me bro :D lets better talk private chat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abasin","date":"2017-05-10T13:57:21.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xing.de.

I don't know how well you speak german, but that is probably what will hold you back the most. The number of jobs that do not require you to speak are pretty low. \n\n> I have found that through speaking to people outside of the UK or, people that do not have English as their primary language are generally nicer than those from English speaking countries.\n\nPrepare for being disappointed. I am sure we germans have some good qualities, but being nice is certainly not one of them. It's not that germans are jerks or something like that, after all we are human like everyone else. It's more like a cultural thing, it is normal to be rather \"cold\", unemotional or distant. It's in no way meant to offend others, but people from other countries often find it disturbing. But I suppose the country most similar to germany concerning this aspect is the UK, so you are already used to that^^\n\n> They seem to have a want and a need to learn.

But trust me, we do have stupid people too. \nThe good thing about germany is that it's very easy to educate yourself if you really want to. Education is mostly free here, which definitely is a great thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Drachir","date":"2017-05-10T04:13:52.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend to search Jobs at big Companys in Germany like: Telekom, Vodafone, BVG, Deutsche Bahn.

And if you dont know a City you want to go to, i can recommend the bigger Citys like: Berlin, Köln, München, Frankfurt since the big Companys have their headquarters there.\n\nAnd you should check out the youtube Channel \"wanted adventure\" she is a native English speaker who decided to live in Germany and makes Videos about Germany and the German Language, you maybe learn something from it, but its entertaining for sure ^^.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KorSett","date":"2017-05-09T21:53:23.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can't answer you, because i don't know how well your german is.
