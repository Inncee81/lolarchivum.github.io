You should meet my sister.&quot;\r\nand from there, I think Jinx sister has been hidden in the game all along. and therefor, Psych came to the light!\r\n\r\nhttp://img11.deviantart.net/7ab2/i/2015/114/3/5/new_champion__psych__by_weakfreak-d8qunrz.png\r\n\r\nAttack Style:\r\nClose combat.\r\n\r\nPersonality: \r\nPsych is never afraid of playing around wild. she can look elegant and beautiful at first sight, but she is always ready to go crazy over everything and nothing. she swings around with her chainsaw and toys and she doesn&acute;t care about foes or friends. the joy of killing is better the closer up she gets up to people to look them straight in the eyes as she takes the life out of the victims with pleasure. she is more calculating to think the best ways how to totally destroy someone by killing them the worst ways possible. and for those who survives her killing-attempt will be nothing but empty shells of horror when she haunts their mind.\r\n\r\nBack Story:\r\nPsychs favorite game she likes to play, is with her sister Jinx. they always played rough as kids, so they made a bet about who will live the longest. so they playfully attempt to kill each other, not caring where or who is around them as long as they have fun.\r\n\r\nDeep in the city of Piltover, in the heaviest armed jail for the worst criminals are put in, is Psych. she was in the crazy room furthest in the jail, all wrapped up for not letting this insane woman out for 3 years. but as she was bored of the place and been playing nice since she got in, she charmed the security guard of her cell with a sweet gentle smile to let her take some fresh air out. the guard would regret doing it, but it was already too late the moment he opened the door, as she easily slips her arms from the clothes wrap she was wearing, and twisted his head before falling to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen she got the guards weapon, she quickly ran down the corridor to get to the room where all the stored stuff that got discarded from the jail birds, and grabbed her clothes and weapons she got taken off when she first got in jail. before leaving the jail, she happily killed all the guards, cops and fellow jail comrades for her warm-up before she hits the city. and now that she is out, nothing can stop her from meeting her sister and play with her.\r\n\r\nWeapon: Chainsaw\r\nhttp://pre05.deviantart.net/646e/th/pre/i/2015/114/5/9/psych_attacks_by_weakfreak-d8quot2.png\r\n\r\nthe attacks (plus giant hammer from under the skirt and glue gun) \r\n\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed designing and making Psychs story. and I do really hope that this champion character I did might be possible as an official champion to the LoL game. but even if it wont happen, I still did my best and happy with that :)\r\n\r\nif you support this character as a new champion, please comment, share and talk about it. I really appreciate the support, and hope to see this crazy girl go wild in the game!\r\n\r\n\r\nif you like to contact me or see more of my art, please visit my Deviantart account here [Weak Freak](http://weakfreak.deviantart.com/)\r\n\r\nwith kind regards\r\n- Weak Freak","replies":[{"poster":"xMyteriousx","date":"2015-04-24T15:33:42.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vi is the sister of Jinx.","replies":[{"poster":"Weak Freak","date":"2015-04-24T15:54:57.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really?

You should meet my sister.\" can be interpreted in a lot of ways,\nsince her \"crazy\" might not be yours. A former criminal who has the potential to be as big a menace as her playing cop might be the craziest thing in existence for someone like Jinx.\n\nThen again it could all be coincidental\n---\nCompared to Jinx, Psych's backstory comes of as weak in my opinion and her kit isn't fleshed out enough to call this a full concept, but I would definetly like to see where this goes.","replies":[{"poster":"Weak Freak","date":"2015-04-24T20:13:44.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aahhh. yeah I had some ideas about the pink-blue contrast could have a connection. but since its not a fact that they are sisters, I stick to my story.\nbut thanks for the criticism and such, its good to hear them to think about molding the details of Psych. this is just my story, details and facts can be changed so it will fit to the game if its considered.\nthanks for the theories btw, it clears up some thoughts around Jinx and Vi :)","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2015-04-24T20:51:27.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Np\nIf you want some help just ask :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
