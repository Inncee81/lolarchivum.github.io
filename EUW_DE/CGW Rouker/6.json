The team exists out of a Coach with tournament experience, a S7 Platinum 2 Midlaner and a S7 Diamond 5 Support. Both players can shotcall and have experience aswell.\n\nTo join the team, you have to speak English or German and have a microphone and headphones.\n You also have to be Platinum 5+. \n\nKindness and Respect is also really important. Also, you have to take the game SERIOUS and not give up if you lost the early game or so.\nWhen the team is built, we would look for an organisation to pick us up as a team to play for them.\n\nWe are going to play in tournaments to get better as a team and as an individual. \n\nIf you are interested add me in LoL:\n\nCeS RÃ¸uker","replies":[]}
