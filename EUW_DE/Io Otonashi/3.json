While I am despairing to get out of Bronze V Solo/Duo Q, i thought &quot; hey, why not search for a team to rank up in Flex Q&quot;. So that&#039;s the reason, why i am searching on this Forum for teammates. If you&#039;ve decided to take me into your team, just add &quot;TukmasterLP10&quot; to League and write to that topic. Now, I&#039;ll {{summoner:4}} out of here and i hope, I&#039;ll find some new friends here ^^","replies":[]}
