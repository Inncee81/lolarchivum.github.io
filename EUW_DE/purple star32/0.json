I just want to play ranked and climb but it's just not possible because the people in your team are too bad. The jungler won't gank lanes that need help. People int 1v5 and feed enemeys so hard that you can't win. Other people get carried. But why do I always get those idiots in my team that go 3/15? I feel like ranked is getting more and more unbalanced","replies":[{"poster":"Empaya","date":"2019-11-02T19:22:53.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like you expect League to let you have that juicy 15:0 win streak but it's not like that.\n\nIf you actually play good every game and impact the game positively, you can slowly (but surely!) climb even if you have some trolls here and there. That doesn't matter. As long as you focus on getting better as a player overall, its all fine my dude :D \n\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PKSquid","date":"2019-11-02T18:17:46.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sowas ist halt immer Glückssache, die sich nach genug Spielen (im 100er bereich zu deinen Gunsten richtet)\n\nIch hab momentan auch nur 1 Game von ca. 13 gewonnen, teils weil Ich verloren hab und oft auch weil Ich durch zufall im schwächeren Team war, wenn Ich jetzt aber weiter spiele wird es sich mit der Zeit an ~50% ansiedeln","replies":[]},{"poster":"MidlaneGod115","date":"2019-11-02T17:47:46.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wo ist denn das Problem? \nDu hast 49% WR, also fast perfekte 50%! \n\nWenn du nicht besser wirst bleibst du da wo du bist!","replies":[]},{"poster":"C4i RID","date":"2019-11-03T20:12:24.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ich kenne dieses Gefühl, ein Kollege und ich haben die Bot jedes mal gewonnen und der rest hatte schon T2 verloren :/\nSpiele einfach mit Freunden und deine Games werden besser laufen :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wekra","date":"2019-11-02T18:41:40.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=purple star32,realm=EUW,application-id=Wj1wcocU,discussion-id=seWpVsm7,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-02T17:42:21.407+0000)\n>\n> The jungler won't gank lanes that need help. \n\nif u need help play safe...jungler shouldnt gank losing lanes","replies":[{"poster":"purple star32","date":"2019-11-02T19:52:26.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My lane isn't loosing but mid is getting camped and the jungler won't help that midlane","replies":[{"poster":"Eroticat Nimar","date":"2019-11-02T22:01:10.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then this midlaner should ward.\nYou get Them for fuckin free.","replies":[{"poster":"purple star32","date":"2019-11-03T16:47:08.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's the point.
