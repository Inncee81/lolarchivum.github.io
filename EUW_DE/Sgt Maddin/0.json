If you create a Dynamic Que lobby and you invite a frind and start for searching, it can happen, that only the invited players get the AFK-check, the lobby hoster will not get the check, and therefor cannot acceptt it. This means, that you get dropped out of the game search and have to start the seach again. It is not a bug that comes from a Computer, it has to be a Client bug since it happened to me (Win 7) and to some of my frinds (Win8) and (Win10). I hope that this is going to be fissed, since till now i havent notice anything, but i wasnt sure enough to post it here.","replies":[]}
