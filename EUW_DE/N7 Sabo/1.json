IT SUCKS even more with that turret. take the data for the old 3v3 map and take some buffs away then upload that shit and DONE. 3v3 FIXED! dont attempt to change it even to a even worse stage. it was a nice try but it didnt work. you failed its fine but return it to the map which worked better. and stop reworking champs which people play rework i dont know hm GALIO 0-something % people play him! GOD. another idea take the old map and rework it a little bit with these altars and that spider BUT keep wards in it. limit it to 2 wards per player or something but not !!!!!000000!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2015-08-14T21:02:46.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never played on old 3v3- would like to do but it isn't able yet.\nBut that doesn't mean the current 3v3 is that worse.\n\nJust one HUGE problem is the Bot-Leveling 24/7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stahlvormund","date":"2015-08-14T20:54:28.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except that you dont like it, I really dont get the reasoning behind the issues you see in the map.\nCare to elaborate with facts and data?","replies":[{"poster":"N7 Sabo","date":"2015-08-26T22:05:25.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you palyed on the old map you know that the old one is a hundred times better and a hundred times more popular than now. i cant find graphs to prove this anymore. i didnt say its complete shit. i said that they should fix it because something ahs to be wrong that it becomes one of the least popular modes when it WAS very popular (okay there were not many modes but it people played it almost as much as 5v5). the perfect way to solve this is to fuse  both. keep the spider adn delete these shrines which are just annoying. get the varieties of buffs back. instant popularity growth. i can guarantee this. \n\nlike i said i cant find these graphs anymore. there were graphs showing the popularity of the modes available at the time (2010 or 2011)","replies":[{"poster":"Stahlvormund","date":"2015-08-27T07:54:20.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, I didnt knew that there was another map pre-shrines.\n\nI actually like them, but I would gladly see a Retro Event with old maps and check it out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
