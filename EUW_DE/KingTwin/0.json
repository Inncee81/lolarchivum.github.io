I wanted to Queue for aaram to get my afk Penalty away. \r\nI accepted all game invites but i couldnt connect to the game.  I still was in Champion select and could even reroll my Champion (even though i didnt get another one ingame). \r\nBecause of that i just wasted more than 40 minutes to connect to a game. \r\nbtw. Im writing this while im still working off my afk Penalty.\r\n\r\nThis text showed up :\r\n&gt;         Unknown Error\r\nAn unknown error has occured\r\nSorry about that. We&#039;ve sent a Report to the Server.\r\nIf you continue encountering this error you may want to check the Support site or Forum for more Information.\r\n\r\nI wanted to log out but then this text showed up\r\n&gt; Exit Now ?\r\n If you Exit the game now you will receive a time Penalty that will stop either you or your Team from entering any match made game! It will also end your league series if you are in one. Are you sure you want to leave?\r\n\r\nWell yeah \r\nI pressed yes and reconnected to the game playing the right Champion i should. (gnar)\r\nI didnt get a Penalty by now but if I&#039;ll get one  I am going to write another post. \r\n\r\nI hope i can get away my Penalty now ;) \r\n\r\n-KingTwin{{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sirius00","date":"2015-10-27T19:26:28.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me, but you are in the rong Board.
