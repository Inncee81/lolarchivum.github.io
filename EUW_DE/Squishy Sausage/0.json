Perfect connection in-game","subforum":"Champions & Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, recently I&#039;ve been playing a lot of games where during champion select I suddenly get a lot of lag, and sometimes even before I get to champion select.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll give you two examples of what happens:\r\n\r\n1.) I&#039;m playing a 5v5 with my fixed team, we&#039;re all in the &quot;searching for a game&quot; screen, then suddenly they are all in the game, and for me it still says that I&#039;m searching for a game. So while they&#039;re picking champions, I&#039;m still searching for a game. So I exit LoL, and every time, the moment that it exits, I hear the gong sound which means I can enter a game, but I can&#039;t because obviously I&#039;ve just quit, and then the game my team are in end because it says I&#039;ve quit, plus after various attempts to get into lobby I get the time penalty for leaving of up to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2.) I actually get into champion select, and we&#039;re in the banning phase. Then suddenly it looks to me like the enemies have missed a ban, but everyone else can see the ban. And it&#039;s just stuck there, I can&#039;t see what other people have picked, and it just stays in the banning phase forever. So I end up getting a random champion because I can&#039;t see what&#039;s going on.\r\n\r\nOn the occasions where I do get into a game, I have absolutely no problems with lag, and my latency is absolutely fine. So what on earth is going on, and could anybody please tell me how to fix it?","replies":[]}
