I can find them in my shop so no links for that.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t really know what to use for his daggers but a lot of people seem to use Craft Foam for Katarina&#039;s daggers so I think I&#039;ll use that for Shaco. I can also find them in a shop in my city so again no links for that.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is I need Shaco&#039;s Arm&amp;knee pads but I basicially cant find them. I am also not too talented with creating them on my own so I thought of buying them. Does anyone of you guys know where I could buy them?\r\n\r\nIf I missed smth on my cosplay please tell me!","replies":[]}
