Dont win the promo and have flaming from selection+int+afk after so 3losses and im down after 19/22 wins from promo to 39lp? \nHow many games does league expect us to win to normalize lp gain?! I am sure nobody can expect to win consitantly so much else wed all be master...\nand no i didnt lose any game at d5 0lp previously\n\nbest regards max\n\n\nmeine güte..... 19 von 22 games gewonnen promo zu d3 nicht geklappt und danach 1 verloren -> 3 loss 100lp -> 39 nach so einem winning streak davor kein einziges auf d5 0lp verloren. selbst nach so vielen siegen und fast 2x rangaufstieg kein gscheiter lp gain macht 0 sinn - wo ist hier bitte die logik im mmr system ich raffs nicht mehr echt nicht","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2018-04-30T21:13:42.660+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deutsches Forum","replies":[{"poster":"WubziIIah","date":"2018-04-30T22:19:10.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"zufrieden übersetzt #schule bildet","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2018-05-01T00:03:51.492+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ich habe in keinster Weise Probleme Englisch zu verstehen oder es selbst als Kommunikationsmittel zu benutzen aber wir befinden uns trotz allem im deutschen Forum.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"eingew","date":"2018-05-01T04:33:19.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Es gibt tatsächlich bereits eine Antwort auf deine Frage von einem Rioter:\n\n> Hey all, have seen a few posts on this recently. While we know there is an issue with low LP gains in diamond 5, looking at the number of players with 0 and low LP scores doesn't show there is an issue with LP gains. If you look at any division you will see a similar pattern. **In fact, 25% of players in every division are at 0 LP and all those players experience healthy gains.** There is two reasons this pattern occurs:\n> \n> 1. Players are driven by standards. This dictates engagement patterns around reaching new divisions. In other words, nobody is setting a goal of reaching 97 LP then taking a break. The goal is always the next division or tier. Similar groupings appear in most systems structured in this way (for example, grading systems with minimum pass criteria).\n> \n> 2. The system is very lenient about demotions, and players cannot fall below 0 LP except by dodging. This means that any player who is technically below 0 LP will still be displayed at 0 until they fall far enough to be demoted. This also means that players climbing back out of an MMR technically below the amount expected for 0 LP will get smaller gains while they climb back up.\n> \n> Why is this important? While we do have a fix on the way in the coming patches for this issue, **it won't change the number of players who are at 0 LP in diamond 5 or any division.** That isn't the problem or really even a symptom of it. I want to make sure the community understands the actual issue being discussed here.\n> \n> The real issue is that LP calcs work differently d5 to challenger. Right now it's tuned too aggressively, so if you're out of sync from going on a losing streak after getting in it can feel really painful to climb out. The change we're implementing smooths out the gains over all of diamond instead of just immediately hitting full force in diamond 5, so it's less noticeable in any given game.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33wpik/25_of_all_diamond_players_are_only_diamond_5_0_lp/cqpjjf9/?context=3\n\n_Tldr:_ In Dia läuft die LP-Berechnung anders und hier müssen Spieler sich weit stärker beweisen, als es noch in Platin und niedriger der Fall war. Ich glaube also nicht, dass das jemals so richtig aufhört mit deinem \"kaputten\" LP-Gain. Das ist so gewollt, weil an die besten 2% der Spieler höhere Anforderungen gestellt werden, als an die Normalsterblichen.","replies":[]}]}
