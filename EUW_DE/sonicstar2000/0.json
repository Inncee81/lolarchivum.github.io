Sometimes during the loading screen League just stops responding. But the real problem is that it Locks up your screen to the point where it is impossible switch the current window and therefor impossible to close the programm. This means you will have to restart your whole PC what if not realized soon enough will usually lead to a remake and you loosing your LP or even Promos.\r\n\r\nBasically if you try to hit alt+tab you can change window, if you try pressing the exit button on league in the alt+tab menue nothing happens, if you press windows key+m nothing happens, if you only press windows key only the taskbar appears and if you rightclick league and chose close nothing happens, if you hit str+alt+del you are brought to the according menue but if you chose task-manager to maybe terminate the exe the task-manager is started but you are still lock in the league screen and therefor are not able to use it because of stated previous problems.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is just sloppy and a disgrace that this still exists and Leauge doesen't mange to handle a full screen like every other game out there. For me this used to happen about as often as somthing doesn't work as intended in the new clinent but since a few years Leauge never stopped responding for me in the loading screen so a assumed this was fixed. I guess I was naive.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant but this is just stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyane","date":"2019-02-23T08:38:09.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Während man auf dem Desktop ist: Taskmanager öffnen, Optionen auswählen, \"Immer im Vordergrund\" anhaken, fertig!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Necromant","date":"2019-02-23T07:50:55.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why schaffen es Leute nach all den Jahren im deutschen Forum nicht deutsch zu schreiben?\nVon daher, liest sich das hier keiner durch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicRedPanda","date":"2019-02-23T01:42:01.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deutesch forum = deutsch Beiträge\n\nRed Pandas = best Pandas","replies":[]}]}
