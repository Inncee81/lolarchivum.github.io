Specifically for Germany and the area around FFM (Frankfurt am Main) , but also a complete list of all Public Viewing parties for the EUW region (sorted by country perhaps) would be nice.\r\n\r\n2 years ago there was a big PV event at my town (Mainz), it was fully booked and received a lot of positive feedback, but they didn&#039;t host it again unfortunately (https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/de/news/community/community-events/erlebe-worlds-deiner-nahe). If you could tell me more about the overall process of making a PV event (do they need a permission, do you approach them or do they approach you etc.) i could ask them to maybe host it again. Due to my personal experience and heavy engagement with LoL...that sounded strange... i am pretty confident to say that still a lot of people would attend such an event and would higly prefer it to watch worlds in company on a big screen.","replies":[{"poster":"xNeoSeoul","date":"2018-10-02T12:32:16.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am looking for a viewing party in or around Hamburg.","replies":[{"poster":"12Eineerdbeere34","date":"2018-10-17T12:57:23.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xNeoSeoul,realm=EUW,application-id=hGYdiTd1,discussion-id=8FhHP3LM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-02T12:32:16.213+0000)\n>\n> I am looking for a viewing party in or around Hamburg.\n\nYeah me too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bayako","date":"2018-10-11T10:10:45.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cologne here, 3 years ago i think was a big ESL Studio Public viewing, but they never did it again i think, even as it was fully booked too.
