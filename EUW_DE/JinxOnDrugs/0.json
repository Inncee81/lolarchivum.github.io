Just tell me if you can wait a week or two for me to reach the elo. I can play every role (playing since s2), but I would prefer to play jungle. If u need me on another role then I can probably get to a good level by practising a lot! I have Teamspeak & Skype, but i can get everything else as well if needed! Add me IG or reply here if you are interested :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"FeS Lowfire125","date":"2015-09-06T10:13:24.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi JinxonDrugs,\nI am interested in your team ;), I am main adc and in diamaond 5 atm.
