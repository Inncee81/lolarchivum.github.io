Both get dmg and no one get the 1 gold for a win.\r\nTHATS INSANE. \"Need 1 Gold? Win the next round! is an advice in the loading screen but then this happens.\r\nIts so frustrating to lose a winstreak because of that, but even more frustrating to lose a 1st place, when beeing in a 1v1 and you would have killed him but URF OVERTIME is bugged. PLS FIX IT, its unplayable right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2019-10-12T11:32:58.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> THATS INSANE. \"Need 1 Gold?
