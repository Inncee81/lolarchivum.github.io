I guess its because of the double-proc passive from the devourer. Pls solve this bug cause in addition i dont get the dmg from my 3 q auto.","replies":[{"poster":"Death Magician","date":"2015-07-18T12:00:32.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think complaining is the wrong word, just wanted to report that bug","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoenerFTW","date":"2015-07-15T17:06:50.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you really complaining about XIN and this DEVOURER shit.... thatÂ´s really sad. Even if it is a bug then they should disable this Devourer shit for a certain time because it is just completely unbalanced.
