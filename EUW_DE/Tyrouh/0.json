He already get&#039;s extra Gold for kills but I still miss something special about him getting assists. Something like a Quote e.g.&quot;Just an assist? That&#039;s Not Worth my time&quot; or &quot;An assist? Embarassing...&quot; or even a hidden passive where He get&#039;s 10 less gold per assist.\r\nWhat are you all thinking about That?  I Would just love it :D","replies":[{"poster":"Marksmansitter","date":"2016-04-20T10:18:52.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven ist nicht dafür bestimmt assists bekommen!.. :p","replies":[{"poster":"Tyrouh","date":"2016-04-20T11:55:12.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gerade deswegen soll er ja so reagieren.
