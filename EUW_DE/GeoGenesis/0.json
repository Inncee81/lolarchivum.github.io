But some day because Humans found out that the Crystals could be used for magical enchantments.The Brackern wasn't really happy about that idea from the humans, better to say they was totaly angry about that. Because the humans builded big mines and colonies on the Cystal scar the Brackern attacked them, that they leave her holy place. Before the runewar started and the Brackern vanished for a long time. A Genius Yordle and a Human researched and builded togehter a Mechanical Guardian for the next century. This Mechanical Guardian defended the Colonies and Mines against Brackern.At a rainy day something strange stays in the air, something dangerous. The Brackern know a war will start in her holy place , the war was named Rune war and the duaration of it was enorm. Because of that war Brackern Vanished and the Mechanical Guardian found no work for his existence, he searched his old energy fuel place and switched his self offline because of no energy.\n\nYears...after years was being gone and the Mechanical Guardian was still inactive, suddenly a strange and unbearable strong magical power apears above the crystal scar. Because the crystals are absorbing magical power , the Machine of the Mechanical Guardian get Fuel for him. The Mechanical Guardian gets a power boost from the Crystals and must realize that he failed in his mission to defend the mines and the Colonies. After the realize that he has failed his program inside in his body located a grandmaster of sience and recalculated a walking route to his position. After a while walking thought jungles,Ice,rocks, and many other stuff he reached the position and he realized he was a ur-grand child from the Human former of his self. After a long technical talk whit this Person, the person meaned he can fix his Hardware and he can help to defend the City Piltover agaist enemys.\n\n\"Piep...

If u think u can be ganked just skill E (Guardian Stance Reactive Mana shielding) up to get less dmg and get away from the danger zone.\nIn Teamfights u can operate from very far away, means u can dmg the enemy allrdy before ur team comes to them. Also u can slow them whit ur Q (Guadian Stance Scatter Grenade) to slow them and give ur team a kill.\n\n**Items:**\nMurama\nIonian Boots\nStatik Stiv\nIceborn Gautlet\nLast Whisper\nInfinity Edge\n\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n**0.1**\n●Changes Magic res per lv from (1.55/lv) to (0.55/lv)\n●Changed movement from 325 to 300\n●Chaged the transformation time from 3/2.25/1.75\n●Chaged Q Scatter Grenade to Guardian Stance and Revealing Grenade to Mobile Stance\n●Added Icons to Each skill Not the ultimate\n\n**0.2**\n●Changed the Hidden Passive\n\n**Skill Changes**\n\n**Revealing Grenade**\n●Reaveling Grenade doesn't reveal not more invsible units.\n\n**Hardware Overclocking**\n●Decreased the Gained Armor and MR from 25/35/45/55/65 to 15/25/35/45/55\n●Decreased the duration from 9 to 6 secs\n\n**General**\n●Added a Gameplay Guide how i would play him\n\n**0.3**\n\n●Updated the Picture with Lego XD\n\n**0.4**\n\n**Revealing Grenade**\n● Added Dmg 60/90/120/150/180 (+0.45 per AD) as Magical Dmg.\n\n**Steam Thruster**\n● Added a Slow 15/25/35/45/55% Effect if a Enemy gets hit\n● Added how far the Thrust effect holds (250)\n\n**General**\n●Updated the Move,Taunt,Taunt2,Dance,Laught\n\n**0.5**\n\n**Revealing Grenade**\n● Changed the name to Epi-Center Grenade\n\n**0.6**\n\n**Guadian Stance Scatter Grenade**\n● Changed the AP (0.4) To AD (0.65)\n\n**0.7**\n\n**Guadian Stance description**\n● Changed description for the Guardian Stance","replies":[{"poster":"Reinhulderahn","date":"2015-02-10T09:53:11.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of i really like the concept, and i would definitly play him as an adc, but i think that he will be very hard to balance because of the immense range and the high swap time(2.5 = nearly a nunu ult channel) he needs to change back to mobile form.\nCould you tell me does he have 65% of his AS left or is his AS reduced by 65% ?

This guy is awesome.\nbut i think maybe a bit less to focused on Teemo shooting xD You can take this as taunt towards him, but not actual gameplay :p\nIs he AD Carry? Big Gun, IE in build.. looks like adc. :D But he is quite hard AP Based, so kinda like Tristana.\nMaybe if you Take the Q to a AD based one. 0,3 - 0, 4 Ratio. That should work.\n\nbut u got my vote.
