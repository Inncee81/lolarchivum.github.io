This though only exists in the stats. In the graphs there is the category &quot;Total Damage Dealt&quot;, but you can&acute;t select it alone to see the over all damage. You are only able to select the subcategorys of &quot;Total Damage Dealt&quot; (in &quot;GRAPHS&quot;). Therefore, in the graph-window, you can&acute;t see the overall damage of the champions or directly compair this to the other champions total damage. You can only see the campions total damage in the stats. I&acute;d appreciate it, if you could handle this like &quot;DAMAGE DEALT TO CHAMPIONS&quot;. There you are able to select the subcategory &quot;Total Damage to Champions&quot;, allowing the player to view it indipendetly and without having to look in the stats.\n\nAlso there is a bug, where in the GRAPH-window, you can click on the check boxes while pressing &quot;shift&quot;. This leads to the check boxes beeing ticked, without changeing something in the actual graphs. You can, for example, tick all checkboxes available, while pressing &quot;shift&quot;. In this situation there would be no visible graphs even though all boxes are ticked. By using this small bug you can also get all categories of graphes to be shown at the same time, which wouldnÂ´t be possible otherwise. The displayed is visually messed up.\nI would really appreciate those minor problems beeing fixed. Otherwise I&acute;m very pleased with the game and hope you as Riot keep up the good work :D","replies":[{"poster":"Gin","date":"2017-04-24T20:33:47.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend to click on the Bug-Icon in the bottom right corner of the client and send your bugreport to Riot.\n\nBtw: You are on the german boards.
