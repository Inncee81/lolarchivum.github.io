I could imagine for example that kha q could apply onhits, trinity force for example, but would weaker that for in the early game, or it has some execute damage on it like the lee sin q, but resets on kill like his evolved e. this would as well fit into his kit- being the reset plane is soooo satisfying to watch, for example in the oce kha montages, I would really love to see that playstyle more, I think riot actually misinterpreted their own champion design there, for me kha is that little bug that sneaks onto you, rips you apart, and transforms into an airplane (ok, a grasshopper..)\r\nI hope riot overthinks some thinks and maybe makes some little changes, to make the game more enjoyable, rewarding, and more like it was probably meant to be anyways.\r\nRegards, \r\nM l R R O R","replies":[{"poster":"CosmicSphere","date":"2017-12-16T19:38:47.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DEUTSCHES FORUM°°°°°!\"\"§gjhdgndrhz","replies":[{"poster":"Doo ","date":"2017-12-16T19:55:02.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CosmicSphere,realm=EUW,application-id=Wj1wcocU,discussion-id=J5Ad52hE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-16T19:38:47.499+0000)\n>\n> DEUTSCHES FORUM°°°°°!&quot;&quot;§gjhdgndrhz\n\nDie letzten 10 Themen waren auch alle gefühlt auf Englisch. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"M l R R O R ","date":"2017-12-20T16:43:58.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ja und? ich bin deutsch, das hält mich nicht davon ab, auf englisch zu schreiben :D","replies":[]}]}]}
