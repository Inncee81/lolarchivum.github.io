Its very important too know how your play style is. If you playing very safe and loves high magic damage so i would advise you {{champion:61}}. She is very strong in Late game has high trade and poke potential and good Ap scalings. \nIf you loves too play aggressiv and loves high risk and normal damage burst i would advise you {{champion:91}} . He is strong in mid and late game, he is mobil and very good too kill squishy(low health champions)\nAnd her a extra advise, this her is a german forum if you want ask next time again so write german or go to the english forums","replies":[{"poster":"HerrLarbe","date":"2015-11-05T13:24:13.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
