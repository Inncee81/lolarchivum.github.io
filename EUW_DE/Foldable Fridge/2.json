I&#039;m just looking for someone to have a good time with and not get tilted as hell after a loss or some fuck ups. I&#039;m the kinda guy who judges only himself, hardly ever anyone else.. considering thats of no help anyway. So you should fit me well, mostly concerning the relaxed and no tilt part... would appreciate you not to flame as well, that&#039;d be great!\n\nApart from that I wish you all a good evening and feel free to hit me up ingame!\n\nGreets,\nRetardedDuckling\n\nEdit: Ich sprech auch deutsch, mein Fehler. :D","replies":[]}
