I just noticed that clash is coming back soon and for taking part you have to be at least honor lvl 2 ... Bout 3 months ago i got a 14 day suspension because of flaming and my honor lvl \ndropped to 0 ... By now I only got from dishonorable to lvl 0 even tho I instantly mute everyone at the start of the game and the tons of honors I require... I&#039;m afraid I won&#039;t make it back to lvl 2 in time .. Is there any way I can make it back in such a quick time? \nTy for every response in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"GitGudOrDie","date":"2018-05-16T19:33:32.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the best way is just play ;) u can get more honors for shotcalling / macroplay like be the one that notes times in chat when enemy flash is up... say ur team to pressure top for a free drag say ur team to pressure sidelanes so u can get mid tower etc","replies":[{"poster":"Say it back","date":"2018-05-16T19:43:06.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ty for your response but .. to be totally honest I dont think the honors are the problem like I get at least 1 honor every game and just today I had 3 games with 3 honors but still honor lvl 0 ..
