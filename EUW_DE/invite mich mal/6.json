Because Dynamic Ranked is an indisputably better experience for playing with friends, the Ranked Teams queue skips the 2016 season while we begin work to integrate the full team experience into Dynamic Ranked. Expect more details about improved organized play later in the year. To be clear, ranked queues for the 2016 season are:\n> \n> *     Dynamic Ranked\n> *     A few weeks after season start: Solo Ranked\n\n[03.02.2016](https://np.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/44094b/ok_its_been_two_weeks_since_dynamic_queue_has/czn6vbe) Update\n\n> There's also some development work left to finish Solo Queue, and we potentially may have to do additional stress testing and optimize hardware again to ensure a smooth launch. When we made the original announcement of Solo Queue, we expected to finish it in the timeline of weeks to month or two, and we'll update everyone as we go. \n\n\n[01.03.2016](https://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/704710112846348288) Update:\n\n>** It's definitely on the way**, we're guessing about a month an a half from now we may see it emerge.\n\n[22.03.2016](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/6WuZKauE-new-champ-select-update?comment=0037) Update:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Socrates,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=6WuZKauE,comment-id=0037,timestamp=2016-03-22T20:11:28.027+0000)\n>\n> Hey guys, we know there are a lot of players who are really passionate about solo queue.
