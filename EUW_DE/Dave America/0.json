But even more recently the badge vanished and I am once again a regular guy.\r\n\r\nLast Year I was not punished and got the skin for my efforts being nice at every circumstances. But there was a game where some premades where being really mean to another player and I intervened and argued. Ofc they pulled the \"Haha we 3 Premades we report u\" move and I have gotten the warning for negative behaviour. Could this be the reason why I have no badge anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"XIII BTLmovies","date":"2015-02-13T18:04:44.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Immernoch die Deutsche Seite.\nWenn du Englisch schreiben m√∂chstes gehe bitte in das Forum http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/","replies":[]},{"poster":"dat Zoidberg","date":"2015-02-13T18:02:13.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, that was the reason. Players are losing badges for reports. If the report was eligible or not doesn't matter. In my opinion this system is not fair because the badges were well-deserved and the reports (possibly) unwarranted.\n\nDon't expect that you will ever earn any badge again, in my experience this seems to be nearly impossible. Hard to get, easy to lose...\n\nMoral of the story: don't argue with idiots. Just mute them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dave America","date":"2015-02-14T11:36:17.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you Zoidberg. You've been really helpful.
