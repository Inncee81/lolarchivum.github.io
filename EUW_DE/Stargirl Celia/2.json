I'm a Diamond ADC main who plays LoL since February 2014. After 3 years of playing for fun I hit Diamond the first time and began to look for competitive teams. Since March 2017 I played constantly in teams with a short 1-2 month break for my highschool degree in 2018. My peak in competitive play was a Battlegrounds tournament where we played vs high Diamond/Master teams and lost the offline spot at Dream Hack 2018 to a full Master/Challenger team. With the new team I want to improve myself and my role in a team even further to eventually play in higher leagues like the ESL. The communication in the team can be english or german.\r\n\r\nYou can contact me in the client (Blobby LFT) or in Discord (Blobby #4736).","replies":[]}
