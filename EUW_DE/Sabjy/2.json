Worth or Not?","subforum":"Skin- & Champion-Konzepte","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Dear Riot.....\r\nyou had a great thought.... You give a skin to a player if he/her plays games or if he&#039;s/her&#039;s  friendly and gives his/her friends/rdm people from their games gifts.... Well.... the thaught was good.... But is it really worth?\r\nI wanted to know how much it would cost if you get the skin with gifting ONLY! And did some calculations.....\r\n1 Mistery Gift = 3.333333333333333 Euro (3.75883333333333295745 Dollar) and 1 Gift gives you 10 Points.... (calculated with 500RP instead of 490RP)\r\nYou need 55 000 000 Points  --&gt; You have to send 5 500 000 Gifts\r\nSo.... 5 500 000 x 3.333333333333333 = 18333333.3333333315 (18 333 333.33 Euro)\r\nNow the next thing.... I calculated with 500 instead of 490 (490 of 500 = 98%)\r\n18 333 333.33 x 0.98 = 17966666.6634  --&gt;  17 966 666.66 Euro\r\nSo you guys can decide..... Play 11 Million games as 5 premades or you pay 17 966 666.66 Euro to unlock the new Skin! :) GL&amp;HF guys!","replies":[{"poster":"XIII BTLmovies","date":"2015-06-12T20:50:34.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo Skin = 975 RP = 6€  Icon = 2€ 4 Spiele IP Boost + 3 Tage IP Boost = 6 €\nAllein schon 100000 Spieler * 6 = 600000€+ 2*100000 = 200000 €+ 4*100000=400000 + 2*100000 = 200000\n6 Tausend + 2 Tausend + 2 Tausend +4 Tausen = 14 Tausend Euro.

That means, every Fullpremadeteam per match generates points and every single mystery gift. Maybe I will now see the first time, that someone gives away a gift in the end game lobby.
