(kenne höchstens ult+W, in genau dieser reihenfolge)\n\nfirst of all, this is the german forum, if you want to discuss a bug, or sth else in english, go to http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/\nand no, there seems to be no kind of bug with the skin, at most there could be some display issues with the lee being a little bit off, he still is as fast as with his other skins. if you are still eager to have a discussion, then i would like to ask you more about that \"W+Q combo\" you keep talking about.\nthe only existing combo, i know about, is the Ultimate+W, which is disables the enemy AND positioning yourself to a the oppositive site to where you want to kick the enemy, while him not being able to do anything about it.\nW+Q is not really working that \"good\" because you will have to wait till your W dash finished, and maybe you time it bad, because you are not adapted to the new skins animation, in which case i would like to advice to train more.\n\nedit: the only known skin, which had any effect on the champ, was the legendary Galaxy rumble skin, in which case his torpedos could be shot with shorter delay, most likely because the animations were shorter for the new skin, but in the case of muhai thai lee, there was nothing changed on his animations, not even his model got much of a rework","replies":[]}]}
