I currently have 700k Champion Mastery simultaneously on different accounts with her, while my Main is sitting at 75k with Mastery 7, and I basically fell in love with her when I first saw her. She was (in my opinion) a very fun and unique AD Carry at that time, as she had potential to carry teamfights pretty much 2v5 (with her Support) and her Passive was a Blessing and Curse at the same time, due to the fact that you couldn&#039;t cancel them, but you were able to Jump after every Autoattack. I quickly picked her up when she was released and she was pretty strong at that time, and, yes I&#039;m admitting it, she was too strong back then when people found out how you play her and got used to her. She had an average of ~70% Ban Rate at some point across the LCK, NA LCS, EU LCS and other Regions aswell.\r\n\r\nBut since the changes to her Attack Speed and the overall AD Carry Rework in the Preseason of Season 6 she kinda fell off, and barely sees play in Competitive OR in Dynamic Queue. I&#039;d desribe myself as a pretty serious player that wants to reach Master one day, and I always Check Champion Winrates and Playrates and just their overall Statistics every Patch. Now that the 6.16 Patch is a few days Old the Statistics Page champion.gg gathered enough information for this Patch. Kalista&#039;s Winrate? 43.91%.\r\n\r\n43.91%. How is that even possible? I mean, it&#039;s not unusual to have a Winrate below 50% on certain Champions, but I&#039;d say that is her All-Time-Low.\r\nI can&#039;t remember the Winrate of her at Release, but I&#039;d argue that It wasnt THAT low like it is now. My personal Winrate on her is at 57.5% in 73 Games on my Platinum Account, which is my main. The problem about this Winrate is, that about 70% of the Games I played on Kalista were before her Nerfs, altough many people said they were &quot;adjustments&quot;.\r\n\r\nKalista&#039;s Crash\r\n\r\nNow in this part of my Discussion I will talk about the &quot;Crash&quot; of Kalista, and the reasons behind it. Im going to compare Kalista&#039;s current State, with that of her Release. Let&#039;s Begin.\r\n\r\n1. The ADC Preseason Changes.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why Kalista isn&#039;t in a good spot right now. In Riot&#039;s 5.22 Patch the &quot;forgotten&quot; AD Carries experienced a lot of changes, aswell as the AD Carry Items. The only changes to Kalista that patch was her Passive and her Overall Attackspeed. While she experienced a small buff Attackspeed-Wise, she was overall nerfed, due to the fact that they reduced Runaan&#039;s Attackspeed from 70% -&gt; 40%, and it now gave Critical Strike Chance, which is not useless on Kalista, but you&#039;d rather get 70% Attackspeed than 40% Attack speed and 30% Critical Strike Chance. \r\n\r\nSo because of these changes I will say that she received a SMALL nerf, because atleast they buffed her Base Attack Speed. After these changes she was still in a good spot and saw some fair amount of play. I can also recall moments where Kalista was banned in Dynamic Queue and I wasn&#039;t able to play her.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion:\r\n\r\n-Kalista received a small nerf\r\n-She was still being respected in Dynamic Queue\r\n-Saw enough competitive play (whilst holding a fair Winrate in my opinion)\r\n-Was in a good spot among all Elo&#039;s\r\n\r\n2. Her Passive Changes.\r\n\r\nNow I dont remember WHEN exactly this happened, but I&#039;d say it was not much earlier than the preseason Changes to Marksmen.\r\nTo make it short, they nerfed her Passive. She didn&#039;t deal 100% of her Attack Damage now, but instead 90%. But that wasn&#039;t everything.\r\nThey also removed a part of her Passive where her Jumps used to be 25% larger when Jumping backwards, and her Jump Range would Scale with Boot-Tier.\r\nNow her passive doesn&#039;t scale in Range, but in the amount of time it takes to jump. To be honest, it didn&#039;t hit Kalista as Hard as I thought it would back then, and I&#039;d say the changes were reasonable back then. I&#039;m not saying that this nerf completely destroyed Kalista, because even after these nerfs she STILL saw enough play in competitive and DynQ, and she still had a decent winrate to work with. I&#039;m just pointing these nerfs out, because theyre one of the reasons why Kalista is where she is right now. I also wan&#039;t to point out that Blade of the Ruined King got nerfed in the %-Damage based on Enemy Health in the Preseason Patch. This Item made up a lot of the 10% Damage reduction on her Autoattacks, but when it got nerfed, Kalista got nerfed aswell.\r\n\r\n3. Her Attack Speed Reduction.\r\n\r\nNow we came to 3. which is in my opinion the biggest reason behinds Kalista&#039;s drop from God-Tier to Garbage-Tier.\r\n\r\nThe Attack Speed Nerfs in Patch 6.6\r\n\r\nNow I don&#039;t know if you can remember the nerfs to her Attack Speed, but I&#039;m gonna summarize it as best as I can.\r\nThe explanation to these nerfs was pretty much that Kalista was &quot;too strong in eSports and SoloQ&quot; and was &quot;dominating&quot; Games.\r\nNow I can&#039;t deny that Kalista was a powerful champion but I wouldn&#039;t say she was too strong. She had some Counter Picks, like Hard CC Champions (Nautilus, Leona eg.) \r\n\r\nAnyway she got nerfed in both her Base Attack Speed AND her Attack Speed per Level.\r\nTo &quot;make up&quot; for these nerfs she now has bonus Attack Speed scaling with Kalista&#039;s Level, when her Soulbound is close to her.\r\n\r\nAlong with these nerfs her Ult Range got reduced a bit, but that didn&#039;t matter too much.\r\n\r\nand THIS is the reason why Kalista in her current state.\r\nI am personally not even motivated to Pick Kalista in Solo Queue. Since the last nerfs (4-5 Months ago) I played Kalista a LOT less than I did before, because her winrate dropped so hard.  in my last 100 Games or so I maybe played like 15-20 Games with her and before I played around 60-70 JUST with Kalista. I had days where my  Match History was just full of Kalista Games.\r\n\r\nSince her Release in November 2014 I can&#039;t remember ANY buffs to her. She always got nerfs over nerfs. Over and Over again, and I think that&#039;s pretty sad. \r\nSince her last changes she didn&#039;t even get touched anymore. It almost feels like Riot stabbed her in the back like in the lore and then let her bleed out slowly until she lost any relevance in the game. Yes, the reference to Kalista&#039;s lore was intended. Riot literally &quot;betrayed&quot; Kalista.\r\n\r\nI personally experienced a lot of hate, and insults in Champselect, just because I locked in Kalista.\r\n\r\n&quot;You idiot, how can you play Kalista, her winrate is so bad right now&quot;\r\n&quot;Fucking troll, this is why you&#039;re still Platinum&quot;\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t pick Kalista, play else please&quot;\r\n\r\nJust to give you some examples.\r\nBefore the changes to her Attack Speed the infamous IMT Toplaner Huni also tried playing her Toplane, and binding to his Jungler.\r\nHe played it to some fair success, but now you can&#039;t even play her on her main Role, being Marksman, because she is straight up weak.\r\nIt wouldnt be that bad if Kalista was able to play Top, Jungle or even Mid, but because you&#039;re so reliant on your Support now, you can&#039;t play her in &quot;off-meta&quot; roles.\r\n\r\nNow that I&#039;m done with explaining her nerfs I would like to get to my recommendations to changing her so she can finally be played again without feeling bad for it.\r\n\r\n1. Remove the W passive and restore her old Attack Speed.\r\nRemove the bonus Attack Speed when she&#039;s close to her soulbound. I get the point that you wanna put focus onto her uniqueness in being able to bind with a teammate and have special benefits for it. But imagine your Support goes AFK, or you wanna fight 1 versus Multi. Why should you be punished for trying to make the best out of the Champions ability to kite? It doesn&#039;t make any sense. Why would you release a Champion with the ability to kite multiple people and then you reduce the Attack Speed when you&#039;re alone. Thats so stupid. This was originally one of the reasons why I loved playing Kalista. You were able to Carry alone if things didn&#039;t go well. But now you can&#039;t even carry when the game is even and you&#039;re teamfighting.\r\nI&#039;m tired of running full Attack Speed Rune Pages with low AD, since my Champion deals only 90% of her AD anyway.\r\n\r\n2. Change her role.\r\nThat might sound a bit stupid, but we saw it working in the past. Mordekaiser was an ADC (even if he was for a short time), Graves was reworked into a Jungler and Gangplank sees a lot of Play in Midlane now. I can imagine Kalista being a Jungler/Toplaner, you just have to (finally) put your fingers onto the champion and do something about her low winrate. I know a lot of other champs are waiting too. But a champion that was once god-tier can&#039;t just be ignored when her winrate is THIS low. \r\n\r\n3. Buff her passive again.\r\nSimple and short.\r\nGet her old passive back.\r\nJump range increase when jumping back, scaling with Boots\r\n100% AA-Damage.\r\n\r\nI personally don&#039;t want to talk a lot more about this because It&#039;s Riots resposibility what happens to champions, but I wanna say that I really want Riot to see this and answer.\r\n\r\nIm done. If you got any questions just ask me, I will answer them ASAP.\r\n\r\nPeace out,\r\nKRADIC {{champion:429}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cayce","date":"2016-08-17T22:24:36.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're in the german boards, I think you shouldn't let your work unappreciated and go to the english ones ;D","replies":[{"poster":"byDomey","date":"2016-08-18T10:41:46.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few Kalista-Lovers such as me in the german boards, who are interested in this topic!
