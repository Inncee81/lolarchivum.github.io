I just see a black screen with the league of legends logo in the middle. After a while i get a popup saying &quot;unable to connect&quot;. Clicking &quot;try again&quot;, exiting the client and reconnecting from the launcher and restarting the launcher dosen&#039;t help. When this occurs, i usually have to wait 10-20 minutes to get into the game, at which point I&#039;m utterly useless and get reportet for afk. Since I allready got a leaverbuster penalty, i would like to know if anyone else has the same issue and knows how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"HoLeFuk69","date":"2015-11-17T09:57:23.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had exactly the same problem. I was in champion-select and when the launcher should switch to the loading-screen, nothing happened or only a black screen. Then this notification: unable to connect to... ocurred and as i pressed \"try again\", still nothing happened. As a result i \"cleaned\" my computer and we changed the provider (we didn't change the provider coz of this problem) but afterwards it worked again. You could try wether it helps to clean up ur computer or not and if not wait for next patch. Maybe the problem will be solved then. If still nothing changes maybe it's time for a better computer ;) ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Jungle GG","date":"2015-11-16T23:08:06.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issues.
