Warwick gains full vision of nearby enemies affected by his passive and can rengar leap onto them once. If the target he leaped to is killed he can jump again and extends the duration of his R buff. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m really bad with numbers/balancing. This would just be a neat idea to make him a little more fun/complex.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Mage","date":"2015-08-23T16:51:16.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude, german forums, go write in german, or join the english speaking communitys.\n\nwarwick gets an rework, just use google, or any other kind of search engine for more information about it, they will add in interesting mechanics","replies":[{"poster":"haha weed lol xd","date":"2015-08-29T05:00:46.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"much translate, very german english, such Google Translator","replies":[]}]}]}
