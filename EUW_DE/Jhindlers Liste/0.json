He was the first champ I liked instantly when he came on the live servers. Today after several buffs and nerfs of him and other items effect him not directly, e.g. Botrk, assasin update, tank updates, i want to ask you if Jhin is viable or if you would either buff him or change him in some ways.\r\nI thought of all his abilities:\r\n- passive: here i think of some scaling changes like a higher attack speed and crit into AD scaling \r\n- Q: maybe let the fourth bounce crit when you kill 3 units/champs before, would fit into his concept\r\n- W: bonus damage when you snare \r\n- E: percentage health dmg to make it more attractive, because today its only used as vision or snare possibility\r\n- R: stack mechanic (hardcore imaginery), more dmg (like kindred) when you kill someone with the ult\r\n\r\nI like to hear your opinions about Jhin, and those are just a few thoughts on making the Champion more unique :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2017-06-22T14:43:09.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wurde er nicht gerade erst im letzten patch gebufft?","replies":[{"poster":"BigSnipe","date":"2017-06-23T14:23:53.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ja wurde er, zudem werden die letality items bald nochmal ein wenig angepasst.","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2017-06-23T17:12:24.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Joa dann hat sich das Thema ja erledigt {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vandalay","date":"2017-06-22T14:53:09.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think that his E needs to be changed and it would be just enough that the E goes up just after the half time in 80% of cases the enemy rushes trough.
