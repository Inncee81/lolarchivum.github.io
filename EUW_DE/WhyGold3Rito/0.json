We went 8/2, he got Plat IV while he was unranked last season in flex,  and i got Gold IIV while i was Gold V last season. I am seriously desturbed why he got so much higher, espacaly because he was unranked last season, and for which am aware, MMR is only calculated from Wins and Loses and the Matchup you face, but we played all 10 games together, so we faced the same stuff and won and lost the same games. Any explenations?
