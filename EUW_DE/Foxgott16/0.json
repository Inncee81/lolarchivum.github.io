As we were developing the new Honor system we ran into a few problems with clarity between the different levels. Turns out making things bigger is not always better. We looked at our color-tiers and realized there were a couple of them, so we needed to make sure we chose wisely. We wanted it to do 3 things:\n> \n> 1. Be easy to understand, which is why it&#x27;s very similar to other games&#x27; color systems\n> 2. Be consistent, so that no matter how you play you understand the progression\n> 3. We&#x27;re not reinventing the color wheel everytime we build a new feature\n> \n> As you pointed out, consistency isn&#x27;t quite there yet! \n> {{sticker:sg-soraka}} \n> With Honor and Prestige, we were able to start fresh. A blank canvas. An empty slate. Freshly peeled potato... but with existing ones there&#x27;s tricky business of changing something players are used to. We&#x27;ve talked about updating Champion Mastery and our Loot Tiers. Would love to hear from you guys what you think about changing existing visuals like Champion Mastery or how you feel about our new color system that we&#x27;ll be using in our future work like Clash! :)\n\n\n\n[Zum NA-Thread (Quelle)](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/EcNFEE9v-leagues-universal-color-tier-system-isnt-universal-yet)","replies":[{"poster":"Foxgott16","date":"2018-05-28T22:54:17.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Danke für den Link.
