For now I assume that you are not able to speak German and will answer in English as well. \n\nIf you start playing ranked for the first time your MMR is on a silver level. The MMR is the hidden elo which determines with which kind of players you are matched- you get players who roughly are in your MMR. When losing games you lose MMR and will eventually play vs weaker opponents (and with a weaker team). The gold player probably had a bad MMR compared to his rank and thus was paired with the silver guys. \n\nAlso you did not play your first rankeds at the start of the season, but in the middle of it. At the start of the season there is a soft reset of the elo, thus you would face waaay better players and your MMR would drop faster. \n\nAfter 10 games you usually are not exactly on your MMR because 10 games are not enough to evaluate your skill. But the more games you play the more exact (usually) is your rank and does not change until you get better (or worse). So after 30 rankeds you should be really near your elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerrorRaven","date":"2016-07-30T03:13:36.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wenn du zum ersten Mal Ranked spielst, beginnst du mit einer Silber-MMR.","replies":[]}]}
