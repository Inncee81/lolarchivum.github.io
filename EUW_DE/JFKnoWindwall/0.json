If you're looking for people to play with and you are over 16, I recommend joining a community called the Chaos Vanguard.\n\nEssentially the Chaos Vanguard (CV) is a multi-gaming community for Europe and NA that aims to provide a fun and safe environment for players. We have a lot of people from a variety of ranks to play with in our EUW section, so there will be plenty of people to duoQ and also just have fun with!\n\nWe have a large website and teamspeak, and we try to host daily events for you to be able to play with people such as aram inhouses, hide and seek, defend soraka bot etc. We've also got tournaments with giveaways as well as organized ranked teams. Competitive teams also get their own channels on our teamspeak. Also we have separate channels for people who duoQ, so they won't be disturbed in the middle of the match!\n\nIf you ever get bored of league you could just jump down to one of our different sections for games such as Counter Strike, Heroes of the Storm, Warframe, Smite and many more. \n\n\nFeel free to add me in-game if you have any questions!\n\nGood luck with your search!\n\nYou can find us at:\n\nWebsite: http://thechaosvanguard.co.uk\nTeamSpeak: ts3.thechaosvanguard.co.uk","replies":[]}]}
