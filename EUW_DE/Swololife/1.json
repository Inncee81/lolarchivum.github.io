Is there any Tank-Skill beside Feast that deals high damage? And Cho`s is absolutely not the best tank atm.\n\nIf you look who is played often and has high winrates on Toplane, yes there are some Tanks like Sion or Singed, but also Non-Tanks like Nasus or GP. Since you played Kindred, so I guess Jungle, you had the tools to take him out of the game. Cho is annoying if he gets some Feast-Kills and gets hard to kill, but he is immobile and easy to gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mondmann97","date":"2018-02-16T15:34:37.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Das ist das deutsche Forum.\nSpiel keinen Adc im Jungle wenn du ihn nicht spielen kannst, besondrs keinen der nur gut ist wenn man ihn perfektioniert hat.\nWenn du Tanks den Dmg wegnehmen willst, musst du sie Schadensressistenter machen.
