Now you changed that Skin? WTF are you thinking? What does traditional mean if you update them just as you please. This is just one sign how you ruin thi game. Nothing seems to be sacred.  I&acute;m pissed as hell about that. Just had to write outf my anger. Thaks for listening. If you feel the same about it pls comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Zanlan","date":"2017-04-19T14:41:29.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"KARMA MAINS UNITE! <3\nMeinst nur das Splash oder?","replies":[{"poster":"Fury of Fungus","date":"2017-04-19T14:45:01.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ja is schon nur das Splash, aber trotzdem.
