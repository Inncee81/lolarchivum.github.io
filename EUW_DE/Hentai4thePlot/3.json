I&#039;m a Diamond 3 Thresh Onetrick since almost 3 seasons now. I started playing season 4 (when Gnar came out). I got placed into silver 1 and climbed one  division each season (S4 Silver, S5 Gold, S6 Plat  S7 Diamond(. I&#039;ve never really played alot of ranked games though. SO I&#039;m not sure if I could&#039;ve climbed more If I had focused on playing more ranked games. I really wanna try to get even higher but I sort of run out of options where I could improve or what I could do better. I watched some of my replays and also tried to copy some mechanics of other higher elo support players. (e.g. Olleh, Aphromoo). But yeah I&#039;m kinda stuck. I&#039;d really apreciate some help :/ . I know coaching usually costs money. But I&#039;m kinda low on it thats why I was trying to reach some ppl over the forum. Well here I am. If there are any questions feel free to ask. Hoping for positive response :) \r\n\r\nP.S. (Sry I didn&#039;t really know on which forum I had to post this so just took esports :S)","replies":[]}
