Rebooted and tried to go on league again. As soon as it shows the League logo it says &quot;Files corrupted&quot; and that all the time until the game was over! Suddenly I can log in again. I swear that is some kind of ddos, and I wanna ask if someone else had that before. It happend to a friend once  before so I wonder if we are the only one&#039;s &gt;:((( \r\n~LJoshA","replies":[{"poster":"TheLuxorus","date":"2018-08-15T01:12:06.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello LJoshA,\n\nit doesn't looks like a DDoS. It looks like you game save got an error when your game starts. When you get DDoS you normaly just get a high ping or \"attempting to reconnect\".
