The issue was we had overloaded champ select with too many sound effects, making it hard to tell when key things were actually going on - like when it was your turn to pick. You'll still hear your own champ when you lock them in.\nThe upside of this is that since the recent patch we're seeing some of the lowest dodge rates ever.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/49ykh1/what_happened_to_the_champion_select_quotes/d0w8qnk\n\n> To clarify, this was part of a package of fixes that improved dodge rates. When we saw dodge rates weren't where we wanted them, this was something we were okay trading to make sure dodge rates are in a healthy place. \nDefinitely not saying this change alone caused improvement here, but it was one of the factors we targeted.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4a0gum/riot_confirms_champion_select_quotes_not_being/d0wjewe\n\n> Right, and the problem is that the champion quotes can be pretty long and would actually stomp the \"your turn to pick\" sound. A further refinement could be muting the champion quote if you're picking next or fading it out when your turn starts. That was more complicated and we had some high priority fixes that we were working on so we kept it simple. \nI do hear you, though, we all loved the champion quotes and thought they were a great way to add more flavor to the experience.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4a0gum/riot_confirms_champion_select_quotes_not_being/d0wochm","replies":[{"poster":"derbonuspool","date":"2016-03-12T15:12:05.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Danke aber trotzdem traurig{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]}
