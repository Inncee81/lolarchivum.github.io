My friends and I had situations in the champ-select - The Client crashes, the person gets a Leaver Buster Cooldown. This isn&acute;t very funny to deal with nor is it fair for the players who get a ban. \r\n\r\nI just want to tell you that - so it would be nice if you can fix this bug ASAP.\r\n\r\nSincerly\r\n\r\nNexocore - {{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nexocore","date":"2016-08-17T01:23:26.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way - I know that this shouldnt be here. It should go to the support - but we think it depends on ingame assets .. If you dont restart the client and get [however] the client visible again and play a game, ALL ingame assets are placed like they are randomized.  \n\nSincerly \n\nNexocore - {{champion:268}}","replies":[]}]}
