I also like to edit league videos especially montages. sry for my english by the way. Im not big on youtube, but I've learned that a montage can be very impressive by using an unknown song. A lot of known songs are NCS (No Copyright Sounds). There are many other Song you can use for that. I hope you know what i mean. Tonight I will upload my new Viktor montage on my channel Börnie TV, but i think it will be online in the day after. If you want to check it out feel free. I also would like to know what program you use for editing this video. it looks like a great start with a lot of potentional! Good work and keep going. Let me know if you want to ask me something.
