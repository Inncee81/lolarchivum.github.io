I like ur idea of skillshot autoatacks a lot, but 180% of ur total ad is a Little bit to much in my oppinion. Lets say that uve 300 AD and a 100% Crit Chance. One Passiv would deal the normal AA damage (300)+180% of ur AD (540) and then u got the crit(*2). That would be 1680 dmg. Ist insane, at lvl 16 u could eaisly do 1680 dmg per second and u r really mobile and uve a 2sk stun. Thats too much. I really like this idea but ist rlly op.\n\nSorry for my bad english, i only learn it at School.","replies":[]}]}
