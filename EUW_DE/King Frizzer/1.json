With the ad Jungle item, Tiamat and Last whisper he does 600 dmg with a single q! And that is just Hilarious i dont know but he just needs his Q and 1 point in his ult to upgrade his  Q to Kill every one onehit. In my opinion he is oper than Ekko right now. You need maybe the whole team to kill him, and after that he got a pentakill. Its just hilarious!\nThank you Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Veezey","date":"2015-06-16T14:45:45.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stahp trolling pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hamrio","date":"2015-06-15T16:54:10.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first: soory(hi for  bad english) kha zix only way to deal dmg is his Q and his auto attacks and his Q range is ~500","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asuna Sweetheart","date":"2015-06-15T16:31:45.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha its not op i think more he need a little buff  ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Funkér","date":"2015-06-15T16:30:41.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brudi, der wurde schon tot generft.\nKannst froh sein, dass der überhaupt noch teilweise viable ist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RosaroterTeddy","date":"2015-06-15T16:13:56.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: This is the german forum, write in german or go to the english forum pages.\nSecond: Look at his winrate, its currently 50,05% following champion.gg - Maybe the most balanced champ of all! If you think he's op, ban him or play him, he's nearly never banned from what i know. If you dont build armor and/or get isolated without pink wards versus a Kha its your own fault.\nGreetings, RosaroterTeddy","replies":[]}]}
