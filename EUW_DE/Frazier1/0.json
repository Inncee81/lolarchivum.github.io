I have the feeling that i lose games regardless of my game knowlege and skills because i dont know hot to make value out of them in low elo games. im sure once i hit Plat again my skills will have more impact so i can get to Dia V by my self. \r\nThats why im looking for a Dia-coach, because in my opinion i already have the knowlege of a Plat player.\r\nSry, but im not willing to spend money on it. But i still hope to find somone who can take it seriously :)\r\nHit me up Ingame: Frazier1","replies":[]}
