Come join our clan and get tilted together! Bloodshed clan is a chill place to have fun. We often play together in custom or normal games. But of course you also can find someone to grind in the rankeds with you. We often do movie nights or just play mini games for fun. Another cool thing is that we have people from all over globe in our community. To join the clan you have to go trough a really small application. You can find the application in the link I left for you. (Pls mention that &quot;Razer&quot; invited you.\r\n\r\nP.s. Don&acute;t be shocked that there is also some crossfire stuff. That&acute;s another section of the clan. The clan consists mainly from League and crossfire players. \r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to see you on our discord server \r\n\r\nyour Razer\r\n\r\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}
