Its all about this \"I want that skin, because it lokks nice to me.\" But if you dont have one to prefer, maybe you shouldn't buy one of them and pic an icecream ore something like this for the money.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Aries","date":"2015-06-28T11:01:59.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I reported this as \"offensive\".

(Wait longer for the skin and the more u will know which one u really like/want)\n\nreternum: looks coller. Animations nearly same as normal reksai\nPool party: not so cool but funny. Animations are different (more). But i think on normal games. enemies could react faster to you. Because i think lightblue is really easy to see. \n\nSo i think eternum does bring a bit more. But i would like better animations.\n\n(my english is not the best. so forgive me the mistakes. :) ) \n\nHave a nice day. ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"tortenmaker","date":"2015-06-28T10:14:57.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey  this is the German Forum.
