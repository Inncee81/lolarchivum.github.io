But I am getting pretty desperate and no thread could solve my Problem so far.\r\n\r\nI have already tried multiple Youtube videos and even contacted the support who also offered me some hotfixes for my Problem. \r\nBut in the end it made no difference..\r\n\r\nThe Problem itself is that I start out with 200-300 frames when I start the game but as soon as it hits laning phase i drop to like 40fps, in later stages even to 30. This occurs on all Graphic settings, even on very low.\r\n\r\nMy Specs allow me to play the Witcher 3 on Ultra in almost all settings fluently... yet it doesnt manage 60 frames in league consistently...\r\nPlease if anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate them!\r\n\r\nMy Specs: \r\n                   AMD FX(tm)-8300 Eight-Core Procesoor 3.30 GHz\r\n                   16GB of installed RAM\r\n                   Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB\r\n                   64 bit operating System and Windows 10 Pro\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Sidia","date":"2018-11-22T09:24:39.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\ncan you monitor your GPU and CPU termperatures while you are playing?\n\nGreetings\nSidia","replies":[{"poster":"BlueShocker","date":"2018-11-22T15:48:16.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\nyes I have monitored them and they seem fine. \nI used CPUID HWMonitor and it doesnt show anything strange..\n\nBesides I can still run the witcher 3 perfectly fine which should take a way higher demand on my cpu and gpu...\n\nany other ideas?\n\nThanks very much though!","replies":[]}]}]}
