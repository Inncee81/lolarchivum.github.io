Finally after fixing this issue i found out that i have now got a 20 min ban for 4-5 games. As you can probably understand I was very frustrated as I didn&#039;t do anything wrong. So at this point in time i would like the ban to be removed as I think I haven&#039;t done anything wrong to earn it my lol froze and there was an ERROR in their systems.\r\nmany thanks","replies":[{"poster":"EpicDieterBohlen","date":"2015-12-06T11:11:33.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when that happens you just have to close the game itself AND the client then restart it. that will fix it. its not an error in their systems, that happens when your internet is gone for few seconds or something.","replies":[{"poster":"somewhatme123","date":"2015-12-06T11:35:47.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay but still I should get the ban removed as i had nothing to do with the afk and i did close the game but nothing happend","replies":[{"poster":"Sirrkas","date":"2015-12-06T11:55:22.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you probably had that issue at least several times, got a shorter leaverbuster penalty and still havenÂ´t fixed it. You were oft enough afk and/or got enough disconnects, to trigger the highest waitingpenalty possible by the leaverbuster. To prevent that in the future, you should take care of such problems earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"somewhatme123","date":"2015-12-06T11:57:11.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no this is the first time\nbut in the early days of my account(levels 4-5) i did leave alot this","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
