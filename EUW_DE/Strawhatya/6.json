I'm main Ad-Carry but I dont play \"the\" meta-champs often. \nI main Twitch, Jinx, Vayne and Miss Fortudine (mostly Twitch), but I am personally quite defensive in the early game, what doesn't mean that I don't tryhard sometimes with Jinx or Vayne ;-)\n\nFinally I can say, that I am older than 18, but it's personally better for me to use Teamspeak instead of Skype! \nI will add you to my friendlist, see you soon, have a nice day!","replies":[]}]}
