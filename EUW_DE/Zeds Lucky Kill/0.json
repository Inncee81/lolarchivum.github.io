But the reason why I wanna ask you something is because i start with a S3 mmr, but my mmr didnt even changed after winning 3 or 4 games. I got still, after winning and winning, no better enemies. \r\nNow, my question is, how much does your wins effect your placements. I always thought that after a win you should become better enemies.\r\n\r\nExample: You start with G3 mmr, you won 2 games in a row and now you have a G2 mmr. Or, you have a G3 mmr, lose 3 games in a row and got a G4 mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"Allerbester Biss","date":"2018-02-04T14:11:19.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gut,dass du deine MMR garnicht kennst oder die die der Gegner weshalb die das getrost egal sein kann :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"and i carry","date":"2018-02-04T02:21:05.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually every win/loose will effect your mmr unless you were allready placed in a seaoson before. You finished s3 in Season 7 so you will play 10 games in s3 mmr (that doesnt mean that you will be placed in s3). If you play on a fresh unranked account every win/loose increases your mmr by 2 tiers.","replies":[]}]}
