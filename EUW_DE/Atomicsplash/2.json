The bug made sometimes when i cast my Ult the target was pulled back into the center instead of following it. That made me wonder.\r\n\r\nWhy dont they make camille ult make the target get suppressed until i finished my ult cast. So that my ult center is where i clicked the enemy.\r\nIt doesnt change much at all but the problem with Camille ult now is that she can be easily sucked into the enemy team when ulting.\r\nThis happens if u ult someone and he instantly dashes and / or flashes back into his team. And believe me it sucks if u loose a tf just because u ult a {{champion:7}}, u loose the teamfight because she reactivated her w and u are standing in 5 poeple. Also u have no disengage left and die.\r\n\r\nCamille is not tanky enough to stand inside of the enemy team and even if u build her tanky she is not as tanky as a normal tank.\r\nThe suppresion or a stun would stop this and the camille ult would always end at the stop u clicked at.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion in tf if a enemy is misspositioned he should get punished for it\r\n\r\nAt last for the adc its not that devastating because he can use a qs and then do a flash {{summoner:4}} \r\nbut mobile midlane are more punished for too agressive moves.\r\n \r\nSo what do u Think is it a good idea or to strong? And if to strong do u have any other ideas against that problem?\r\n\r\nThanks for ur Comments!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Roxãs","date":"2017-12-11T17:44:04.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wie wäre es, wenn du den Thread, wenn du im Deutschen Forum postest, auch in Deutsch formulierst :')","replies":[{"poster":"Atomicsplash","date":"2017-12-11T22:03:53.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hubs sorry kann ich den irgendwie in international umstellen","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryXenon","date":"2017-12-13T09:07:34.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strg c, strg v","replies":[]}]}]}]}
