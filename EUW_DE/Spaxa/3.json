He had exhaust and I couldn&#039;t do anything but try to grab cs without dying. He seems really strong after the Buffs and the first time I played vs him I did really bad. This game I ended up winning 5/2 but it&#039;s probably only because they had 3 AP and I just built Hedrinker -&gt; Edge Of Night / Mercury Boots -&gt; Cleaver to survive. With less MR I&#039;m pretty sure he could have just dove me. So how am I supposed to play this lane? Or is it a matchup like Jayce and Riven is supposed to lose it and it&#039;s fine if she just survives?\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn&#039;t go Lethality Runes/Thunderlords vs him so I can go aggresive early on? But the Setup helped us out a lot and got us 3 kills as we were about to get really behind so I don&#039;t know...\r\n\r\nFun Fact: I had so much MR that he did about 46% of the damage with AA to me as I tried to all in him but ended up dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Hannibal L3ctor","date":"2017-02-15T06:41:42.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fun fact. this is the german forum","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doo ","date":"2017-02-15T18:35:05.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact: Riven counters Vladimir","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViviD VooiD","date":"2017-02-15T04:54:24.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?","replies":[]}]}
