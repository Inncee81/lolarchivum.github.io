I am not even half way through getting to 30 and I already notice one **BIG **thing..... and that is, how toxic every one is to **THE FRENCH **players (AKA _baguettes_). Its crazy how everyone can be having a great time in game and all of a sudden someone catches wind of another player being French, and the whole chat goes to toxic, unadulterated shit. I mean, everyone seems to despise them, to the point of even telling them to &quot;Go die Frenchy!&quot; or making comments after a bad play like &quot; Of course the F***ing _Baguette_ didn&#039;t use his Zhonyas!&quot;. There are times when there are 3 players  being toxic to one another and the quiet _Baguette_ says something in French, and everyone puts aside their differences to gang up on the French kid! Like holy cow! ive never seen something like this in my life. Its quite remarkable much more toxic EUW is to one another more than NA is. I thought everyone was a dick over there until I came here. This is a whole other level of a shit storm. \r\n\r\nI am not complaining about it, I&#039;m just telling the community how you guys roll in the eyes of a foreigner.  Not like you care..... please don&#039;t flame me. You  guys are brutal...... \r\nBTW if someone can tell me how to switch  my language on the site from German to English, that&#039;d be great =)","replies":[{"poster":"BenitoMalzzolini","date":"2017-06-21T23:10:06.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its quit depressing to read something like this from a foreign. well, its not like i didnt notice it all, but i never thought it would be so obviously and extrem. maybe 2 weeks ago i talked with a friend about toxicity. i was sure, there wont be a huge diffrences between na and euw.\n...disgusting.\n\non the the right upper corner (under your summoner name) you can change the language **Westeuropa (Deutsch)**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirrkas","date":"2017-06-22T09:38:18.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the reasons for this experience could be, that you are effectively a smurf and encounter a lot of other smurfs. There are probably a lot of them, who play on a smurf because of a restriction, they got on another account, like a 14 day ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rena","date":"2017-06-22T09:09:46.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I am not the only one who likes French players :D\nSeriously tho i think you should just try to ignore it or motivate the person who is being flamed. You can't change the fact that the EUW League community is so hateful towards french people. I mean ofc it's sad that people do this but i mean it's the same with racism (as an extreme example). We can't really \"remove\" that but each and everyone of us can say something positive about it so maybe it changes as a whole in a good way :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kind Prow","date":"2017-06-21T23:24:36.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive also noticed this, but i never thought that it is such a big problem. Maybe its just because im playing alot with firends, but in my games noone ever seems to think about such things.\n\nOverall i never noticed really brutal language in my games. Maybe i should investigate there. But thats not the matter. Even if there are players, who hate french peole and flame them for being french, its no reason to stand beside and just comment the situation in a forum. \n\nIt is our and especially your duty to do something. We, the German OT, have a very well connection to the french boards and we found many new friends there. And i think you can do the same thing in your games.\n\nPS: The only thing i hate, is when people write in their mother tongue through a whole game (even if i can understand what they say). I think for a good communication everyone should use english.\n\nPPS: Welcome to the german Forums, the place which has never seen any Rioters :P","replies":[]}]}
