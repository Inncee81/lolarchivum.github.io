This white screen is very bright and especially on later times of the day (for example american LCS games in Europe) can be harsh to the eyes. \r\nI just want to give you feedback, that this screen can simply be exchanged for a darker tansitioning screen (like black), that would be much more comfortable for the eyes.","replies":[{"poster":"KNZ0","date":"2015-06-26T01:13:46.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deutsches Forum ...
