There were some leaks that Taliyah is getting a Skin called \"Crystalheart Taliyah\" but its not sure. I dont think it would be better than the Freljord one but better than no Skin. \nI would love to have Taliyah with a ssg-skin especially if they are as good as the last ones (Nami backport sushi xD)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritgod","date":"2017-11-19T20:27:42.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with the OP. Taliyah is such a nice Champion with so much Skin-Potential.
