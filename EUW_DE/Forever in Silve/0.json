At the beginning of season 5 I used to follow Incarnati0n. I watched his stream and even when he didn't stream I watched his games in the league client. He played with the Account Incarnati0n v2 but now it seems like he did a namechange because the Account Incarnati0n v2 is now in Platinum 1. Since he got Challenger with this Account after a few days it's impossible that's him. So I want to know: What happened with his Account? Does anyone know sth. about it?\r\n\r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"Alustus","date":"2015-02-21T22:40:06.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ist der nicht lebensl√§nglich gebannt?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madchickendinner","date":"2015-02-21T19:01:18.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wem?","replies":[]}]}
