Victors Q ability &#039;Siphon Power&#039; blasts an enemy or minion with dealing a bit dmg, giving a shield and empowering his next basic attack. As long as I tried and found the bug, he works at every level and with all items I took with Victor. \r\nSo when u push an enemy&#039;s tower with Victor and there are of course your minions and In this case also enemy&#039;s minions at the enemy&#039;s tower. If you use &#039;siphon power&#039; on a enemy minion, but won&#039;t hit it with the empowered basic attack u will have a few seconds to hit anything with the basic attack. If u hit the tower, u can not only hit the tower one time with the empowered basic attack (as it should be), u can hit the tower as long as u have normally time to hit anything with the empowered shot. So the empowered shot isn&#039;t removed from victor as long as u have normally time to use the shot. So u can get 2-4 empowered hits on a tower. Who knows how powerful this shot is in late game, also knows that in this case victor can take a tower down as fast as an full build adc in late game. \r\nIt only works on enemy towers (not sure for all buildings), but at every time and I think with every item, i only tried it hitting enemy&#039;s normal minions, not sure for champs and super minions, but I should work too.\r\nSo if u want to try, push a lane with victor and your minions, go to the tower and wait for enemy&#039;s minions. When they arrive, use your Q (siphon power) on a enemy Minion, but don&#039;t hit with the basic attack. Use the empowered basic attack to hit as fast and as often ( depends on cool down) only the enemy&#039;s tower. \r\nA small feedback would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaji Senpai","date":"2015-08-24T13:47:26.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nyes it's true. But it's not empowered when using it on a tower (as much as I know). It's just the animation of an empowered basic attack, but deals the same amount of damage as a normal basic attack.\n\ncheers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorisDynasty","date":"2015-08-24T13:46:37.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"German forums, so german answer.\nDas ist kein Bug, der Q-Charge wird einfach nicht verbraucht. Der Schaden vom Q wird nicht auf den Turm übertragen. Er wird lediglich gespeichert, bis er abläuft oder auf ein legitimes Ziel gehauen wird.","replies":[]}]}
