When i hovered directly over the enemies and attacked them it felt like my AS was 2,0 and when I used &#039;A&#039; it felt like 1,5.\r\n\r\nIf you know how to fix that, or why it is like that please tell me because I personally think that this is very stupid and should get fixed.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your answers :D\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I am very sorry if this is not well written because I am not that good at English :)","replies":[{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2017-12-08T23:02:44.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You attack faster on Kalista while not jumping.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesusonline666","date":"2017-12-09T18:04:08.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this only happens with kalista?","replies":[{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2017-12-09T21:07:05.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does only happen with Kalista as she is the only Champion with such mechanism.\n\nImagine urself throwing things and throwing things whilst jumping.\nIn which Situation you throw more stuff? :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
