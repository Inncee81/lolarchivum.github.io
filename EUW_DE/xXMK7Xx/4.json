This is what is commonly referred to as a \\\"ghost game\\\".","url":"http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/sbeFsWzA-game-crashedstuck-on-reconnectghost-gamefirewall-error-please-look-here","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We have seen a resurgence of drophacks recently across all League of Legends servers worldwide. A drophack essentially results in a small subset of players facing the “Attempting to reconnect” message while playing their games, with a possibility of the game never finishing or disappearing from one’s match history entirely.\n\nDetecting and preventing cheating is an ongoing challenge, and we're constantly improving our technologies to this effect. We have multiple projects in the works that should improve the experience, but we still need some time before deploying them to Live. We can’t guarantee an end to all drophacks, as we all know this will forever remain an arms race, however we strongly believe that this will impede those with malicious intent.\n\nSimultaneously, we kicked off suspension proceedings against all accounts involved in drophacking, past or present. Similar to last year's ban waves, we won’t be showing any mercy and all corroborated accounts will be permanently banned. No warnings or two-week suspensions, just pure and simple account closure. The ban waves have already started, and we expect to get a vast majority of the accounts processed by the end of this week. It will take some time to complete, but the delay remains in line with our general approach: we have to be 100% certain that a given account is guilty. We are confident in our ability to detect offenders, and aim to decisively punish offenders.\n\nWe don't expect the ban waves to immediately reduce this trend however. The decision to perpetrate drophacks has more to do with personal attitude, one's ethical standards and personal respect for rules and other players. We want League of Legends to be competitive, but we want a fair rivalry and a positive challenge. We believe that players attempting to drophack have forfeited their right to play our game and be a part of this community.\n\nExamining the data, we don't even see any great rewards coming from such behaviour. Guilty players only see temporary personal benefits: a few additional LP points saved that they would have lost otherwise; maybe a promotion, but is it really worth it when you’re jeopardising your entire future with League? The temporary and minor reward doesn’t make up for the extent to which drophacking hurts the experience of fellow players.\n\nIn Europe we’ve already rolled out a number of “reinforced” permanent bans (ie: legal prohibition of accessing any of our services under penalty of prosecution) against extremely negative players, and if we notice the same people repeatedly displaying extreme toxicity or antisocial behaviour, we will expand this group further. We hope to deploy the fix soon, and thank you for your patience while we’ve taken measures to address this issue. We would’ve liked to have posted this message earlier, but wanted to make sure that you would know how seriously we take this problem, and hope the actions mentioned above ensure the best possible League experience for the community going forward.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this update, and we hope you’ll feel an improvement to the experience very soon.\n","replies":[{"poster":"EddySmurf1e","date":"2015-05-13T02:52:19.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Erklärt dennoch nicht das DDosing einzelner Spieler in ranked Games.\nSchaut mal auf elitepvpers.
