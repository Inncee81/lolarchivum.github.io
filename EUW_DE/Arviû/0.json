The first one was an Ezreal &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; wich remaind on at the same area and glow the whole time. The second one was a Heimerdinger auto attack i am sry i dont know an better description. This &quot;aa&quot; was two or three sizes larger than a normal &quot;aa&quot; from Heimerdinger the creepy thing was that the particle rotate strange fast. unfortunately i cant show you some Screenshots. But i hope this bug report is still helpful.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day and fun in your Ranked Games Twialun.","replies":[{"poster":"Blurm","date":"2015-08-10T14:23:52.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Du kannst auf deutsch schreiben :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deathinger","date":"2015-08-10T14:23:00.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zum englischen Forum gehts hier lange http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/\n\nMir sind bisher keine deiner beschriebenen Bugs aufgefallen hab aber auch nicht so darauf geachtet :)","replies":[]}]}
