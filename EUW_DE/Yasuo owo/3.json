Don't be scared by what I play in SoloQ I'm open to play whatever champions are nescessary for us to suceed, I just like to have a little fun in soloQ.\r\n\r\nI'm 22 years old and from Germany. I play League since season 2. I'm a calm and collected player with vast game knowledge and able to play all mid champions. I've been on several teams and tournaments before but all on the smaller side. TS and Discord available. I like to play aggressive in mid and push advantages/ look for roams and invades. My biggest weakness is tunnel vision/ not knowing where the jungler is currently.\r\n\r\nIGN: Kaze no Katana\r\nSerious Inquiries only!\r\nHope to hear from you guys soon!","replies":[]}
