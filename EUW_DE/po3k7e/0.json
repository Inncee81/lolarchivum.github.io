But like a lot of other high skill champs they get gutted and I don't understand why high skill high reward champs have to be thrown away. Look at {{champion:86}} he is braindead but gets buffs. Not only does nidalee get direct nerfs but alo indirect nerfs targeteed at her like the removal of SotA and gutting {{item:3027}}. So riot please tell me why, but I do understand that you dont want one tricks to terrorise solo qeue but come on LoL developers team please.","replies":[{"poster":"Bananenschnder","date":"2019-06-03T13:35:50.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because like other high skill champions such as Ryze, Azir, Akali, LeBlanc, Irelia, apparently Yuumi, (...) she is SO strong in the right hands that they can't buff her without ruining the game for the higher ladder and proplay.
