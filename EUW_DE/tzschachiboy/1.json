And with your ult your able to take out carrys like a zed does but you can survive much longer. There are many ways to play her. Jungle, top or supp. You can go more tanky or more dmg based. And she got like 0%ban rate. Look at Fizz ban rate. Poppy can be a very good main but u need timing for her too. Just try her in some normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bemte","date":"2015-08-08T22:40:13.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also zuerst mal bist du im deutschen Forum, also kannst du ruhig auf Deutsch schreiben - deinen anderen Posts nach kannst du das ja. :)\nDann suchst du einen Champ, der zu deinem Spielstil passt. Du erwähnst aber mit keinem Wort, was dein Stil ist...\nDarüber hinaus: probier doch einfach alle drei aus und guck welcher dir am besten gefällt; da es nur drei Stück sind sollte das kein all zu großes Problem sein.","replies":[]}]}
