I love skins! Skins are a main part of this beautyfull game, so why dont we give them **more credit**?\nTo complete this mission we need to totaly reform the skin market! So here are my thoughts on that:\n\n_Which basics have to be changed?_\n-Skins should be dropped after a game or if a player opens a package (This packages should be bought directly from Riot Games)\n-Skins should not be bought directly from Riot Games, but from other players\n-Every skin should get its own worth in RP based on its appearence and its rarity, set by the comunity\n\n_What will be changed for Riot Games?_\n-Riot Games will have no loss in profit\n-Riot could also get a bigger profit, because the skins will loose its worth with the time, but the RP wont get cheaper. Example: Player 1 gets dropped a Skin, worth 10$. Player 2 will buy RP to purchase it from Player 1. More skins drop and it looses worth (offer>demand). Player 2 will sell the skin for less and has to buy RP again in order to be able to buy a 10$ skin again\n-They would make the world a better place =)\n\n_What are the advantages for us as players?_\n-We will be able to get our hands on more than only 1 skin, although we only purchased RP one time (by selling a Skin and buying another one)\n-A very nice skins will function as a type of a status symbol\n-Other players could be exited to get to see a very rare skin\n\n_Special feature_\n-What would you think of being able to bet skins on real E-Sports events (LCS;LCK;...)?\n\nThis were my thoughts on giving skins more worth! But of cause its not on me to decide whether this is totally rubbish or a good idea.\n**Please reply and tell me your thoughts on that! I will be happy to comment on them and discuss this with you!\n**\nGreetings your pluppy!","replies":[{"poster":"Enderized","date":"2015-06-19T22:01:40.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Allthough it's an amazing idea to have a ''Player-Shop'' as i would call this idea, i have to tell you that you are in the German Forums which you can see in the URL\n> boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/-->de<--/c/skin-champion-konzepte-de/XI9XmgUu-skins-why-dont-we-give-them-more-credit\n\nTry to speak english or go to those english forums.","replies":[]}]}
