Nor the other players, neither RIOT. So I make another approach. These bugs appeared roughly after the \"cleaned\" and \"improved\" map patch (5.6 I believe, thus long after the new map itself) and they get worse with every single patch.\nI don't care about downvotes anymore, I will post this list under every news. I will take away from it if something has been fixed and add if a new one appears (I know many, who give me information about this). These are not the \"come on, no game is bug-free\" problems. These are the serious, \"I can lose a ranked game\" problems (this is why I don't play ranked anymore). I get that many people doesn't care about these. Lose YOUR game because of them, don't care in YOUR game. But don't punch us in the face, because there are SOME, who wants an improvement. I don't judge you, so do the same.\nI truly had enough, as many others for that matter, and I am at least trying to do something about it. I love this game, and I would love LoL to be a famous, internationally accepted e-sport game. But it will never make to the top with this attitude. So don't be afraid to join me. If many are together, there will be improvements (like I bet there will be a new Zac skin, if you, who wants it, won't give up on it ;) )\n\nLoL's most disturbing bug list:\n- Invisible Nidalee spears (especially with the skins Bewitching, Pharaoh, Headhunter, Warrior Kingdom)\n- Invisible Morgana Q-s (since her \"champion update\")\n- Invisible Sion ult\n- Abilities disappear -> they go on CD, but nothing happens on anybody's screen, nor do they make any damage. (Again, not just me, I have been asked also, and I didn't see a thing)\n- Ignite/smite won't go out and there were no CC involved. (The champion attacked and cast abilities, but the smite/ignite. It was 2 charges and remains 2 charges. And yes, we pushed the right button.)\n- Champions can cast abilities while silenced (for example Lee is trying to escape from Garen when he silenced him and in the middle of the silence - the silence-sign is still on him - Lee kicks Garen away. He DID NOT start the ult before the silence)\n- \"jumping minions\" -> they walk normally then suddenly they appear way ahead than before. (with a stable 60fps and 35 ping)\n- Turret not always hits enemy champion even if it is under it and attacks another champion. It still targets minions for several shoots then switches to enemy (if switches at all). (It happens not just with \"OMG it should target the enemy, how could I die?!\" situations, or with ranged enemies who can \"play\" with the turret range. Usually this bug happens during melee vs melee, plus it also happens when I or my teammates attack and don't get hit by turret)\n- Bad hitbox -> abilities connect when they shouldn't and don't connect when they should (it seems like a Thresh hook goes through the minion for example. NOT JUST with enemies, \"my/my teammate's\" abilities can do the same...) I have been told that this problem exists because of slower syncing of the server. More and more people plays so the existing servers cannot handle it very well. This is true, even the \"pros\" have it. Check out Sp4zie's video (Ashe commentary, from 3:25 - 4:00). RIOT promised us a better server-room in Amsterdam. 2 years ago... Nice progress on that field. If you want money, don't use skins for it please, make a news about \"fundraising money for servers\" or something. I would give money for that \"freely\", I guess many others too.\n\nI bet that sometimes when the enemy writes in all chat that he is lagging, he is truly not. Just having a bug and he likes to think that this is lag. Or something like this.\n\nAnd I didn't even mention, that the Tribunal System is down for more than a year now. And it shows... Everybody reports everybody for no reason for \"verbal abuse\" because that and the \"afk\" is the only thing what the automatic system checks. Nothing more. (For the record, I have never been banned so nobody can say: \"Yeah, this is a true always-having-chatban-for-no-reason talk\".) Riot promised us a pre- and post-game chat reporting system, so you could report the trolls in banning phase or after the game when they abuse you all in allchat. This was the idea. Where is it RIOT?\nTrue, there is the \"no-priority line\" now. Well... it is NOT that efficient.\n\nI hope that some will join me. Together we can make a difference.
