I would either play as a top laner in a team, or as a mid laner, since im currently swapping around between those roles in soloQ, for top lane im by far more into fighters, bruisers, damage dealers than tanks and i think most teams dont prefer to have a non tank player on top, so probably mid is the way to go, but u decide :D Ask me out for a Role and i will focus on playing this role of course. You can add me Ingame under my Summoner Name \"Cúrse\", would be good if u comment under this post when u added me and what your summoner name is, because i got some requests and dont accept all.\r\nHope to hear from you soon, \r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nCúrse\r\nMaurice","replies":[{"poster":"Energum","date":"2019-03-02T11:17:38.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently working on building a team (players all Plat 1 atm).
