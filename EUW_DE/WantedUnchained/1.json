But this patch has gone too far.","replies":[{"poster":"Bemte","date":"2015-08-21T20:18:05.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. This is the German board, feel free to write in German.\n2. As mentioned in the patchnotes for 5.16, the patches 5.17 and 5.18 will be used to rebalance some of the stuff done in 5.16 if necessary. So just wait for a few days, he might get nerved pretty soon. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"WantedUnchained","date":"2015-08-21T20:27:26.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thans","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scarmaster","date":"2015-08-21T20:27:57.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the best part is the darius buff :D no comment","replies":[]}]}
