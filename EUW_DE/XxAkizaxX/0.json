Mastery level 6 and 7 have a higher competitive bar as far as performance requirements. Alternate game modes are intended to offer variety in play with a less competitive standard for players. We want to maintain mastery levels 6 and 7 as achievements specific to high performance in competition, so they will only be achievable in SR modes. - Riot Socrates\n\nQuelle (letzer Absatz):\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/chromas-yorick-and-champ-mastery-ask-riot\n\nMÃ¼sste deine Frage beantworten.\n\n{{summoner:2}} \n\n~ Tuxedo187","replies":[]},{"poster":"KleineQualle","date":"2016-09-02T23:17:39.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leider bekommst man im Aram keine Marke","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sebbo99","date":"2016-09-02T23:16:57.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man bekommt im Aram keine Marken weil du dort ez 50+ assists ansammeln kannst","replies":[]}]}
