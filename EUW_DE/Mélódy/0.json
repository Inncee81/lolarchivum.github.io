It really is.\r\nThere is a way too huge pool of champions or abilities that simply have no counterplay and fell SUPER SUPER crap to play against. The problem here is that you cannot even nearly ban enough champs to deny them from being picked. \r\n\r\nThe problem also lies, next to the bare existence of champions like Kayle and Ahri, in certain abilities. Stuff like Yi w, Nautilus R, Malzahar R (And I play him myself) just seem very out of place in a meant-to-be competitive game, which it really is not atm. I feel like that every game is (almost) entirely decided by who picked the more broken and better champs. I've been playing this game for almost half of my life now and it REALLY never felt so shit to play. \r\nThe mere unbalance (and for me riots hate for mages) make league unplayable. UN - PLAY - ABLE.\r\n\r\nGoing into the pure gameplay, there are multiple abilities that need fixing:\r\nAhri's charm for instance often hits you through minions, which it certainly should NOT.\r\n\r\nYi W makes him nearly impossible to kill for most of the champions in the game, especially for mages who try to finish him off with autos. His damage reduction is just wayy too overtuned.\r\nKayle's ability to 1v5 a fight with 0/6 stats against a Morgana in the enemy team, which happened to me recently, is just bullshit.\r\n\r\nHonestly, there is so much more you could mention here, but there is no point going over it.\r\nRiots balance team know that what they're doing is nonsense more often than not and even though they ARE trying to fix the imbalance, they are still miles away from doing that. \r\n\r\nSumming up, the real problem here is not entirely in the imbalance itself, but in the fact that the imbalance provides that a game is again (like some time ago) decided by the weakest member on the team. That one member is enough to snowball an unfair champion's lead to a point where there is simply no counterplay, what the game should actually be about, though.\r\n\r\nI really hope riot get their stuff done and fix the game.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know I am going to get A LOT of hate down below, so just go ahead and flame me anyways.\r\n\r\n(About me: I am a former \"higher elo\" player, who played a lot of semi-competitive league. I have (and I'm going to be honest here) quite a number of permabanned accounts, because league pisses me off A LOT. Atm, I am Gold 3, trying to climb to diamond only queueing fill, which has become almost impossible because playing a lot of roles and champions is a HUGE disadvantage nowadays (which is also bullshit btw).)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, now go ahead and flame me, I deserve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \r\nCya, hope you pick the right champions in your ranked games.\r\n\r\nLucifer","replies":[{"poster":"Ðunamic","date":"2019-04-25T16:31:51.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"counterplay to aids champs? pick another aids champ","replies":[]}]}
