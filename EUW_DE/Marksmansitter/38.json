Das soll zeigen wie ihr es in die elo geschafft habt. Ihnen ist aber klar das es nicht alle Probleme l&ouml;st aber es soll ein erster Schritt sein.\r\n\r\nBeim Teamranked hat wohl nicht damit gerechnet das der relativ kleine Bereich (Dia5+) an Spielern diese Teamranked sehr vermisst. Sie wollen aber keine 5v5 Q permanent wieder bringen, da die Queue sonst in Zeiten wo nicht so viele spielen wieder ewig dauern w&uuml;rde.\r\nStattdessen wollen sie eine geplante/zeitlich begrenzte TeamrankedQ versuchen einzuf&uuml;hren. Im Moment denke sie noch dr&uuml;ber nach welche Zeiten und welche Wochentage am meisten Sinn machen (n&auml;here Infos in den n&auml;chsten Wochen)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT AND RECOGNITION IN DYNAMIC QUEUE\r\nIndividual achievement isn&#039;t given the same recognition in Dynamic Queue, and this has left some solo-only players feeling disenfranchised. We&#039;re shipping a feature in 6.13 that ought to help: ranked emblems.\r\nThe goal is to give you another tool (alongside your rank and champ masteries) to show what sort of player you are. We&#039;ll track your win history and premade size, and once you reach 25 wins in Dynamic Queue you&#039;ll earn either a Solo Emblem, a Dynamic Emblem, or a Team Emblem. The emblem you earn is based on the way you&#039;ve queued up for your previous 25 wins, and you can only have one emblem at a time. Emblems have no impact on matchmaking, but they&#039;ll show up on the ladder and will be accessible to third-party tracking sites through our API.\r\nSo how do you know which emblem you&#039;ll get after 25 wins?\r\nSolo Preference Emblem: Queue alone for most of your games\r\nDynamic Preference Emblem: Queue with varying team sizes for most of your games\r\nTeam Preference Emblem: Queue with full teams for most of your games.\r\nThe ranked emblems system isn&#039;t retroactive, so it&#039;ll begin awarding emblems based on the first 25 wins you get after it launches.\r\nWith solo queue gone, there needs to be better recognition of individual achievement. We&#039;re committed to solving this problem, and we think this implementation of ranked emblems probably won&#039;t completely solve this issue for the players who are least happy with dynamic queue. We&#039;re seeing emblems as one step towards a better system, not as the end-all-be-all solution to the problem. We want to see how this is received before we move on to other options (and we are looking at other options).\r\n\r\nSCHEDULED RANKED 5v5 TEAMS\r\nWe disabled ranked teams at the start of the season because we were unsure how match quality would be affected by the addition of dynamic queue. Now that we&#039;ve limited high MMR players (Diamond 5+) to solo, duo, or trio queues, those players have no option to play ranked as a group of five. Even among the much larger population of players who fall below Diamond 5 (about 99% of all players), we&#039;ve heard that people miss the ranked 5v5 queue. They miss the unique challenge of managing a consistent ranked team without the constraints of tier restrictions. Queue population issues prevent us from bringing back a permanent ranked fives queue, because we can&rsquo;t guarantee reasonable queue times in off-peak hours. Instead of giving up on ranked fives, we want to try a potential solution: scheduled ranked 5v5 teams.\r\nOther than the fact that this queue will not be available 24/7, it&#039;ll function exactly like the old ranked 5v5 teams queue did. We&#039;re still evaluating exactly what time and days for each region make sense, so look for more info on this in the coming weeks.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Donkèy Kong","date":"2016-06-18T08:41:34.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think, it's a good start in the right direction, I really miss those 5vs5 team ranked games >.<","replies":[]}]}
