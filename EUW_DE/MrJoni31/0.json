If you remove the shadow of his ult this would just remove so much fun and outplay potential of zed.\n\nThere are many ways for countering zed, for example qss and zhonias, or various ults (liss, kayle, etc)\n\nIn lategame Zed already has a hard time to do something when the enemy have those items built and if you cant swap around with ur ult anymore, zed is just nerved to the ground.\n\nI think zed is extremly balanced right now, hes not even picked/banned every game. You have to be able to play around the enemy team and their items, to be awarded. That takes some game awareness and skill.\n\nzed should stay as he is","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirPacifista","date":"2015-04-07T02:44:21.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, its not high enought, he is far too mobile and has far to less possibilities to counter (and builing Zhonyas and quicksilver is NOT a way to counter somebody, that wouold mean you lose a lot of movebility and damage only to survive 1 ult.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nack321","date":"2015-11-24T19:21:09.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think zed is to overpowerd with some items i think ist unbalanced this kit i think he should have lower damage because ist not normal that a champ make 450 damage with 1 a and 1 full item with no damage and only krits and so stuff with only 198 damage why ist so a shit game vs a zed he can use so fast ulty that you cant use zhonias fast enought and thet buff of the range is not cool for all adc or alll champs with not many hp have big Problems so why a buff nerf him....","replies":[]}]}
