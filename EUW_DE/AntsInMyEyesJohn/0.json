Now I got ranked in Silver III, got to Silver II and now I dropped in 2 days to IV. Sure I also have bad games and Im not the best, sometimes Im taking kills with support, Im not blocking, maybe could take better items, or whatever. But Im trying to play save, Im warding, I prefer letting my adc farm instead of engaging, but it doesnt help. Im trying to stay friendly, pinging, whatever.\r\n\r\nIm having vaynes just autoattacking. Im saying, dude, melee minions 2 Turret hits and you lasthit. They dont care, no reaction, but flaming me, when I fail. Nasus keep going top, feeding, 1/10 doesnt care about pings, advices, anything. Anyone any advices how to climb as support? Everyone just saying, when youre better you will climb with the time. I dont see that. Anyone any help for me, what I can do? Maybe get rid of playing support and start playing ADC?\r\n\r\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=AntsInMyEyesJohn","replies":[{"poster":"Happy Rhino","date":"2018-01-22T23:51:02.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a mathematical law, that you will have more wins than losses on the long run, if you keep playing better than the average player in your division. That means, it doesn't matter even slightly, how often you get \"bad team mates\" on the short perspective.\nJust keep playing good and you will rank up. If you see, that you keep losing and losing on the long run (~50+ games) and it's not stopping, it usually means that you play worse than the average player in your current elo. The more games you play, the safer you can assume, how good you are, compared to the players in your elo.","replies":[{"poster":"SSI CptHaunted","date":"2018-01-23T09:42:04.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the loses where you think your mates ruined the game tilt you way more than the games were you were not that good, not talking about those where you screw up completly.\n\nI had that one game a few days ago where we started pretty bad, managed to come back and open their nexus to attack, but then our adc went afk in base and we had no chance 4 vs 5. My Score was not that bad and if the adc had stayed with us, we probably would have won and still I have to ask myself if I could have done something better, from keeping my lanes from losing early game, to being too risky in teamfights because I was pretty fed and so on. Sure I could blame it on that afk guy and it is his fault too, but I made mistakes myself and if I want to climb, that is what I have to take care of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gwadon","date":"2018-01-22T23:18:37.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were S3 with 99 LP at the end of S7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Herr HÃ¼bsch","date":"2018-01-22T21:26:55.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"better learn german or change the boards.. thats the thing I can give you","replies":[]}]}
