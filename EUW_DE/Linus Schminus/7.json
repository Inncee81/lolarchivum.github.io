We hope to expand the size of our clan by doing so. At the time we are a group of about 130 players who regulary join and play on our TS3-Server with an average of 30 players online at a time. \r\n\r\nOur League of Legends Community is not that huge yet. Often played games are titles like CS:GO, Arma 3, PUBG and RBS6. Our goal is to gain more popularity by working with teams who are regularily playing on tournaments like ESL Go4Lol. Those teams should change their current Team Name to a &quot;German Unicorn Squad&quot; related one. In exchange we offer a private channel room for you to practice. Depending on how many teams are interested in joining us you could even have your own scrim partners.\r\n\r\nAt the moment our server is supported by about 10 Admins, Mods and Supporters. The owner is &quot;Der Pl&uuml;nderer&quot; aka Alex who is also regularily online. As far as I can tell, we have an in general very kind community. If there appears to be any problem with a specific player, he or she gets several warnings until being banned. In some cases the entire community gets asked if the player is &quot;ban worthy&quot; by doing a Straw Poll.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, please consider the idea with your team and if you came to the conclusion that you would like to join us, just log in on our server and discuss any further questions with one of our supports, mods or admins. \r\n\r\nIP: 37.187.244.188:1337\r\nWebsite: Still in work\r\n\r\nGood luck on the fields of justice!\r\n\r\n\r\nTheLegend27/U&ntilde;derdog","replies":[{"poster":"Feel The Love","date":"2017-07-29T16:42:27.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im deutschen LoL-Forum auf englisch Ausländer suchen ? ja why not {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Linus Schminus","date":"2017-07-29T16:44:15.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dachte das wäre generell für EUW, habe keine Funktion zum umschalten gefunden.","replies":[{"poster":"Feel The Love","date":"2017-07-29T16:45:00.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Uñderdog,realm=EUW,application-id=ElKI1ocy,discussion-id=5tsxEWTX,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-29T16:44:15.062+0000)\n>\n> Dachte das wäre generell für EUW, habe keine Funktion zum umschalten gefunden.\n\nrechts oben in der Ecke unter deinem Summoner Namen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
