I&#039;ve heard from quite alot people that they have the same issue with this game like me and (as expected) a lot of bugs.\r\n\r\nMy Issue and the issue of many other people is, that in championselect im getting disconnected and there&#039;s written &quot;Trying to reconnect&quot;.\r\nAND PLEASE RIot: Don&#039;t answer me with the message &quot;Please check our connection guide, because the issue is caused by you&quot;\r\nMy connection is perfectly fine and i have not even a single problem (referring to connection) with any other games I play.\r\nOnly your game has these kinds of issues, in particular.\r\n\r\nI really hope that you will fix this problem, because I&#039;m getting punished by not banning/picking due to this bug. It really takes the fun away.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m aware that you have to pay your employees and that you need money from skins, etc... but you really really should focus on fixing alot of (gamebreaking) bugs.\r\n\r\nP.S: Vandyril is popular for finding many many bugs. But I&#039;m sure you know him already :)\r\n\r\nkind regards from a big League of Legends fan.","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2017-06-06T15:09:12.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sieht aus als hättest du dir viel Mühe gegeben, aber wir sind trotzdem im deutschen Forum c:","replies":[{"poster":"YOUNG SPAGHETTI","date":"2017-06-08T21:20:19.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ne, viel Mühe war das nicht, ich wollte nur in internationaler Sprache meine Wut ausdrücken, damit auch jeder darauf aufmerksam wird :D","replies":[{"poster":"Gin","date":"2017-06-12T23:12:56.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bringt dir leider nicht viel da du hier im deutschen Forum postest.
