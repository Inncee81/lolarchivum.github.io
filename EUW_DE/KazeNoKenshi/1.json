Perfect randomness, getting unranked in gold 3 vs platin team, next round getting all golds vs unrankeds. Normal draft is even more fun, 3k normal wins here, getting put with newbies who aint even lvl 30 sometimes, while not duoing, who dont listen to a single call, and only flame you, while thinking this game is Cod. What. the. hell? Not even a bit fun anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"xXEpicVayneXx","date":"2015-03-24T19:46:50.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the hell is with the english Forum? :D\nThis is the german Forum:F","replies":[]}]}
