Skin title is &quot;Hot Rod Hecarim&quot; and in it Hecarim wouldn&#039;t be half horse anymore, instead he would drive and badas Hog Motorcycle, and instead of his normal weapon he would carry something like Firefighter Axe or even a Baseball Bat. His head could heave his classical color or it would be changed into red fire-ish color (Would be like Ghost Rider too much tough) or he could even heave some helmet on his head. I leave rest of his desing to you, dear Rito (I tought of something like a black jacket). I think that many players would like to see this skin beacuse it would be so damn cool and awesome. Please make it happen (You would make a normal LoL player happy {{champion:32}} )","replies":[{"poster":"Tibmag","date":"2015-05-13T12:03:53.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"German Forum - Deutsche Sprache ...","replies":[]}]}
