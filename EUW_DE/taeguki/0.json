Often i find myself typing &quot;_wp_&quot; or &quot;_gj_&quot; into the chat, but this could be made a lot easier by just adding a &quot;_Well Played_&quot; or &quot;_Good Job Ping_&quot;. It could just display a &quot;_thumbs up_&quot; symbol or something.\r\n\r\nThis might make games more enjoyable as people stay more positive because of the good &quot;feedback&quot; they are getting.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think below pls.","replies":[{"poster":"Wekra","date":"2017-08-29T21:12:30.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all this is the german forum but nevermind.\n\ntyping\"gj\" needs 2 secs, but pinging in bush and typing there is a ward or a vision ward will need more time including the fact, the mate might not see the ping where is the ward, so this new ping is quite useful.\n\ngj is not relevant in time, it doesnt matter if you write it immediately or 20 secs later, but when a jungler comes around u need the time to prepare the gank and give him the vision information..\n\nincluding the fact that it would make the game more complex if we add to many unnecessary pings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hakkuu","date":"2017-08-29T23:14:11.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically a good idea.

It is no ping that needs to be used in order to have better teamplay from a gameplay perspective, I just thought it would be a neat thing to have for us lazy people. If you want to use it you can, but if you do not it doesn`t make the teamplay any worse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sihari","date":"2017-08-29T22:24:46.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think that we will need a \"GJ\"-Ping. \nIn the near future we will get the new emote-system, which will allow us to show a quick \"thumbs up\" after a nice play~ Having a ping for the same thing would be redundant.","replies":[{"poster":"taeguki","date":"2017-09-02T14:10:35.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An emote basically does the same thing, so i agree with you on that point.","replies":[]}]}]}
