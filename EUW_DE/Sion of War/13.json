Toplne is my main rolen and I am kind of a one trick pony on Sion. I dont mind improving or adjusting to new team comps or to try out new champs. In game I am &quot;Anti META God&quot; and as my name indicates, I mostly play off-meta champs such as Sion (whos coming back) Donger and yes i have lvl7 on Satan(I am evil with an evil laughter XD). If you are intersted in a reliable person with a bit of gme knowledge kontact me, I m looking forward to it. TS and headset are there and ready to be used (you will have to turn up the volume for me though).","replies":[]}
