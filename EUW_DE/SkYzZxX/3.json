This was an intentional action, with the aim of removing content for the following two reasons. \n> \n> The content removed was either due to be released in an upcoming sale, or in-store legacy locked content that was not meant to be available for purchase via this promotion. \n> \n> This has since been adjusted, with these deals being removed and replaced with new ones for players affected. I understand that this is not ideal for the players who&#039;s preference was the original deal, and am sorry to be the bearer of bad news in this instance.\n> \n> That being said we are currently investigating a solution for players who had received &quot;Dragon Blade - Riven&quot; as their mystery deal.
