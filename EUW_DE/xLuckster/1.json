Usually i thought for doing a mistake in league of legends, i will get punished for it, if the enemy play&#039;s it out well. On the other hand i want a reward when i land an awesome thresh hook on the enemy adc. This usual behaviour of punishing mitakes has been removed by having tham kench in the game. He is the counter to your own team mates if they do alot of mistakes, because make them disapear. I land an impossible ,,Madlife Hook&quot; ? He eats the adc and runs away like a douchebag. I think if you guys at least double the cooldown on devour, he would be much more balanced and would have to look out on how he will use his W. It&#039;s not ok that he can use this skill more than once in a team fight since this spell is so strong. And this is just talking about one spell of his kit. I haven&#039;t even talked about his extreme duelling potential. He shouldnt be so rewarding for running into 3 people, killing one of them and then getting out alive. I love his concept and i hope that you will balance this champion that he is still strong in his kit and in his strenghts, but has more clear weaknesses. I think also that his ult is a little slow in terms of, activation and actually getting to the point you wish to be. If this skill of his would be made a bit better, he would really still shine after some needed nerf&#039;s. I really hope the King of the River will stay will come away from the title of being ,,The Douchebag of the Rift&quot; and will shine in a fair and balanced way. Thank you very much for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"haha weed lol xd","date":"2015-10-31T04:18:32.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong Board mate. \nThis is the German Board, aka the Douchebag Board, where everything Riot does will be defended. \nYou dont even need to try to start an Conversation, since they will just bla bla to Oblivion. \nMove on to Reddit or English-Board. \nThose are the only Sites Riot checks for Community Stuff. \n\nTo your Text. \nI agree what you wrote there. When is started to play LoL i had to learn, that i get punished for Missplays, Miss-Positioning or Stuff like that. Since Tham, you can play like an Idiot and get away with Idiot since he can \" delete \" you from Summenors Rift for a couple Seconds ( he can even flash while eating an Ally ).\nFirst of all, this dont fit in anything we learned in those past years of LoL and second of all there is no Counterplay. \nWhen i land an amazing Stun over 2 Walls as, let me say Lux, and catched the enemy ADC cause he was going into unwarded Area, i should get this Kill or atleast burn him down so he is weakened alot. \nSince Tham he will be just fine as he was before and my Abilitys will be on CD\n\nI mean, even those mighty Pro Streamer youtuber guys i dont watch agree with the Stupidness of this Champion.

It's just true, that Tahm Kench can be counterplayed and I already saw Games where he was useless, but sure I play him often and I win often, but look: in low elo there are almost no Tahms. And in higher elo they can counterplay him. And for sure there are Champs which are very more stupid like Fiora. Tahm isn't very effective in every Lane. \nSo can just every stop cry, because he loose against him and start to learn from these games to be prepared against him.
