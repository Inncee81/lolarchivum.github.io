So i decided to cheer up RIOT. So RIOT... listen to short story about Bob.\n\n**Bob the Rioter Minion**\n\nSome time ago Bob was just another minion, whose serial number was 184466. He has been waiting for his turn to go to the Fields of Justice to fight for his team, which only differs from its rival with the color of robes. He believed that the differently colored warriors are their enemies, that they have to fight them, and believed that the champions fighting for his color are good. Bob would have probably remained an ordinary minion whose turn would have come, and like all of his comrades would have given up his life in the Fields of Justice. But he was saved by a small glitch and his serial number. In contrast to the other minions Bob was curious and witty. He learned to make his way to the very end of the queue, where the endless crowd of his fellows were marching forward to the battlefield next to the Nexus. Through the distorted crystal of his Native nexus Bob watched different warriors fighting each other, killing his fellow brothers and eventually may even destroy his Nexus ... But there was something that haunted Bob ... The heroes that fought in the last game for his color could fight the next battle against it... In the case of mercenaries such as is the Sivir that was clear, but in the case of honorable champions like Garen... Something was wrong... Something was terribly wrong ... But Bob didn't have time to think carefully about that back then. After all, the one thing scared Bob the most was how easily the champions wiped out whole groups of his fellow minions. And Bob decided to train. Train diligently. Train more. Train harder. But his abilities were so weak in comparison with the champions that he still could not possess any serious threat for them.\nAnd finally his day has come. The minion with the serial number 184466 stepped forward and his feet touched the stones of the Summoner's Rift. Bob marched forward shoulder to shoulder with his brothers towards the enemy nexus. They faced a group of enemy minions along the way, but enemies were less in numbers (probably met a champion on the way) and the next squad of allied minions managed to catch up with Bob's. With enemies defeated minions cheered up... But then they met a champion. Her red hair was fluttering on the wind. Scar across her eye made her look predatory and dangerous. She looked stunningly beautiful and extremely frightening at the same time. Two blades that she was holding were longer than Bob and his hat together. With anticipation and fear Bob rushed towards the enemy - who retreated into the jungle. Then… his comrades and him were showered with blows. His brothers were dying in a couple of hits and the enemy was restoring her health from killing his brothers. Bob was almost dead after two blows, terrible and invincible enemy was about to finish the job. But then another champion appeared. That one was from the Bob's team. His armor was clanging as he walked. His sword was shining like the sun. \"Demacia!!!\" - he shouted and swing down his sword at enemy. And for 2.25 seconds the enemy stopped throwing daggers and moving at the speed that exceeded the reaction of Bob's eyes. Their duel ended as a victory of Bob's ally, woman retreated… Simply just disappeared. Judging by the sound, she jumped behind a rocky cliff that separated that part of the jungle. Champion-savior, without a second thought moved on. He did not sympathize Bob for his loss, did not ask how Bob was feeling … And Bob... Bob has just stuck. Back then, in those ancient times, Summoner's Rift was not so well explored place as today, and the League of Summoners was just beginning its work, so some accidents happened from time to time. And Bob was in the middle of such accident. His minion's sense told him says that it the shortest road to the enemy Nexus was… on his left and on his right… at the same time!.. Bob got lost in the jungle! Unable to choose the way, Bob trembled standing in one place. And at this time his brothers were dying in fierce battles on lanes. Bob was hearing their cries, their cheers. But Bob could not choose which way to go. Enemies were winning and at some point Bob's Nexus was destroyed ... And he had to go back to be the first one in line for the next battle. It was something all surviving minions had to do. But Bob has seen too much and he still could not handle his sense of direction. Therefore, he did not come back by the time the battle started again. Scared Bob realized that he was in the middle of the starting fight yet he wasn't even assigned a serial number! He did not know what squad he should join. He did not even feel the enemy Nexus. And then Bob looked down at his clothes and was horrified ... It was bicolor ... Without knowing which faction Bob held allegiance to League magic clearly identified him as minion and painted Bob in both colors making everyone both his allies and his enemies at the same time...\nBob was too scared to do anything in this battle. He was hiding. He was wandering around the jungle trying not to meet anyone until he was noticed by his friend with the shining sword at 16 min. Bob waved his hand being happy to meet him. But his \"friend\" was not as friendly as Bob wanted. He raised his sword and brought it down to bicolor minion's helmet rendering Bob speechless. Bob wanted to say \"Wait!\", he wanted to shout \"it's me!\", he wanted to clarify that he (Bob) is not the enemy, that they even fought for the same team before, but the champion was not listening. Bob tried to defend himself, but all his attempts were useless. He had already accepted his fate, when suddenly... The redhead woman jumped out from the tall grass. She ran to the warrior with her daggers piercing the joints of the armor. Her blades struggled with warrior's sword, and he did not have time to repel the attacks. In the end the scarred woman put the warrior to rout. Warrior quickly accelerated running right through Bob further away from his pursuer.\nBob was shocked. Bob was speechless. But when the sound of Nexus crystals cracking brought him back from the state of trance. Bob had already made a decision . He made a decision and was going to achieve it no matter what. Since that time a lot of accidents occurred in the League. In one of the days all the minions suddenly stopped and didn't not want to go anywhere. On another occasion, the turrets stopped shooting. Whatever strange happened, whatever summoners complained on, all that was Bob's doing. It was he who organized minion strikes. It was he who inspired minion stoppages. It was he who was behind all the problems that League has been hiding behind the \"under construction\" signs. It was Bob who was doing all this. It was his fierce struggle for the freedom of minions, his revolutionary speeches, his obsession that has earned him many supporters among the minions. He was accepted in any Nexus. He has never been turned in to the League, no matter what threatened his fellow minions. Bob was elusive.\nThe Rebel Minion, The Revolutionary Minion, Bicolor Freedom Fighter. Bob. That was his name. Serial number 184466. But minion's life is short. No matter how many minions Bob recruited, all of them died on the battlefields. No matter how fierce he fought victory was nowhere to be found. Champions were still clearly stronger. The League summoners were fixing all problems caused by Bob and his supporters. And then... Then Bob realized that there was only one way. He must fight. He must make a stand. He must become a champion. A champion of the League.\n\n**Relations**\n\"Garen and Katarina - I will remember you both as saviors…and as executioners.\"\n\n**Abilities**\n*Rage of the Small Ones(Passive)*: Bob's autoattacks deal additional physical damage to champions based on the number of minions slain by his target.
