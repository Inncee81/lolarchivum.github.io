Entweder kann man sich während der Threaderstellung auf die Sprache achten(\"Titel hinzufügen\",\"Füge einen Link hinzu (optional)\" oder \"Schreibe deine Gedanken auf\") oder man kann die Titel der letzten fünf Minuten betrachten.\n\nAnyways, the choice between Red or Blue Smite is an interesting one. If you are going to be counterjungling a lot, i`d recommend Red. If you are going to be ganking a lot or have a Jungler with no/conditional CC (Poppy, Kayn) i`d recommend Blue. But the choice is very teamcomp-. and matchreliant. If  the enemy has no escapes, Red`d be better. And if you have to split, also red. You can think of the two Smites as the two effects of exhaust: One reduces dmg and the other slows. Which you need more is up to you. If you have no idea what you need I can really recommend either [op.gg](http://euw.op.gg/champion/statistics) or [metalol.net](http://www.metalol.net/). \n\nMfG Sirius00","replies":[]}]}
