So I thought I would just try this Tank Akali Build because I also saw something similar in one of Westrice's games.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqnU6RHYbPI","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqnU6RHYbPI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I&#039;ve been playing Tank Akali in the past few weeks a lot and I really was enjoying it. \r\nThis is just supposed to be an idea for other Akali players or/and general players to play this amazing champion in that very funny way.\r\nAkali gets pretty much all she needs by getting her gunblade, the rest of her build is mainly preferences.\r\nShe is a very nice splitpusher and a thornmail helps her a lot against AD splitpushers like Jax, Nasus, Tryndamere, Irelia etc.\r\nSunfire Cape is already well known since the burn effect while being invisible can be pretty nice.\r\nI also like Gargoyes Stoneplate because Akali&#039;s cooldown on her main combo and the duration of gargoyles are kinda similar.\r\nThis prevents her from being cc&#039;d and bursted after her engage and makes her a dangerous and annoying threat for a longer time.\r\n\r\nThe video is just from my smurf in Mid-Gold, but this is still better than a big percentage of EUW players so maybe you can learn something and want to try Tank Akali aswell :)\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nKunoichi\r\n\r\n&quot;As balance dictates&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Overloard99","date":"2017-07-27T21:10:34.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try going to akali mains reddit and see what they have to say about this build.","replies":[]}]}
