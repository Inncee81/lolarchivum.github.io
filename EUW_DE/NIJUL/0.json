It seems to be, from time to time, fairly unfair to me.\r\n\r\nFirst, i measure &quot;fairness&quot; in &quot;How many games everyone has played.&quot;. Players around 100 games should be similar strenght and a player with 1000 games or more should be stronger, just because he has more experience with the Champion he plays, the matchups and the game in general, right?\r\n\r\nExample a game i just had (luckly my Team won so i didnt get 9x reports, maybe just 4 ....)\r\n\r\nI played first time Irelia vs Humans, had some games vs Bots to have at least a feeling for the skills etc.\r\n\r\nI have around 110 normal wins and 300+ aram wins and i am silver 5 (what is to be expected).\r\nThe average of normal wins in the game was 508 (3 player with 200 wins and 1 with over 1000, the rest around 500) with a dia 5 and gold 4 in the enemy team and my team &quot;only silver&quot;.\r\nThats like the other extreme game where i got a plat3 as enemy when i had a lvl 27  (!!!) acc and the avg wins was around 300. \r\n\r\nHow the heck can that happen? \r\nIs it the time? The game started around 22:10. Are there not enough player in my spectrum of &quot;strenght&quot; online to have a balanced game? The game popped after 1 min queue time for me. I wouldnt mind to wait 3-4 or more minutes to have a balanced game, where i dont feel like wasting 20 minutes fighting a uphill battle with the constant &quot;omg noob&quot; &quot;uninstall&quot; &quot;report&quot; and offensive language everyone experienced. That is not fun for me.\r\n\r\nOr is it that this account is pretty old? i made it in 2012 got it to lvl 20 and then stopped until i started league again this year.\r\n\r\nI want to know, if it is an exeption or it happens frequently to everyone and how to avoid it.","replies":[{"poster":"Marksmansitter","date":"2015-08-20T04:31:21.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bsp.:\n\nSpieler 1: 500 Normals --> Bronze 1\nSpieler 2: 500 Normals --> Silber 2\nSpieler 3 300 Normals --> Dia 4\nSpieler 4 300 Normals --> Silber 4\n\nDer skill eines Spielers hat nichts mit der Anzahl an normals zu tun.. die einen lernen schneller aus ihren Fehlern bzw. lernen einige nie draus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maexle","date":"2015-08-19T23:52:40.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also want to know something. Do you realize that you are in the german forum?\n\nI think that it happens frequently since the ranked elo and the amount of normal wins does not influance the normal matchmaking ","replies":[]}]}
