Since the situation in question is Darius' E and Last Whisper versus Darius' E and Black Cleaver, I'll first say that Black Cleaver also has reduced returns, and I'll also do some demonstrations with the situation at hand.\n\nDarius' E gives 25% armor pen at rank 5, or in other words you will be hitting someone as if they have 75% armor. Adding a Last Whisper (35% armor pen) will then treat that 75% armor like it is 65% armor (35% reduced). The end result is 75% * 65%, or .75 * .65 = .4875, or 51.25% armor penetration (LW giving about 27% in this case). Last Whisper also gives 40 AD.\n\nFor Black Cleaver to analyzed we should also note that Black Cleaver gives % Armor reduction that stacks. Armor REDUCTION will always be applied before any penetration, as it is actually effecting the enemy's stats, not your own abilities as with penetration. Black Cleaver will thus allow your team to deal more damage as well, but remember that it relies on stacks (5% per stack, for a max of 25% reduction). Because armor reduction is applied prior to armor penetration, this will also stack multiplicatively and produce reduced returns.\n\nNow to the math. Darius' BC will give you 25% reduction of enemy armor, leaving them at 75% armor. Darius' E is next applied, giving a further 25% penetration, or another 75% effectiveness, leaving the enemy with (.75 * .75 =) .5625 = 56.25% effective armor, or a reduction of 43.75% (7.5% less than with Last Whisper). BC also gives 10 flat armor pen, which is applied last. Depending on the opponents armor this 10 armor pen may be worth more or less than the 7.5% extra armor pen that Last Whisper will provides. It is good to note that Black Cleaver has other stats that will almost surely make it more useful to Darius, including 200 Health, 10 more AD, and 10% CDR.\n\nMore lengthy math (just algebra really) shows that for the two setups the effective armor pen of Last Whisper is greater than that of Black Cleaver if the opponents have armor equal to or greater than 133 armor. I'll type it up if requested, but at the moment I don't want to waste the space for something someone probably won't want to read.","replies":[{"poster":"AlKaido666","date":"2015-05-31T19:31:59.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HufnemStyle,realm=EUW,application-id=ImBE6GqA,discussion-id=UT2FKj6c,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-31T17:47:34.467+0000)\n>\n> sry hab jetzt nur eine englische erklärung gefunden\n> \n> \n> % Armor pen DOES stack without a cap, but because of its multiplicative stacking it will produce reduced returns.
