I know this is silly but I need to buy Lux Elmentalist Edition without  letting my parents know because they will get mad and won&#039;t allow me pay for a game  , so I can&#039;t use paypal or mastercard or anything that has to do with banks , I can only use redeem cards like amazon gift cards and google play ones , I can&#039;t go to media market so I can&#039;t buy Riot&#039;a RP cards , I can also use the mobile phone&#039;s netowork but it seems a bit more expensive and 20 Euros won&#039;t be enough .... in the normal methods like PayPal , 2800 RP + 450 RP bonus costs 20 Euros while using mobile network I can only get 2495 which means 20 Euros won&#039;t be enough to buy that Lux&#039;s pack , so is there any ways to pay like amazon or google play store ones ? \r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/IHDAGTv.png[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"recon","date":"2017-05-16T09:24:04.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first of all, this is actually the wrong board.
