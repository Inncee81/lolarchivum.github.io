We're still going to do patch notes (albeit with less context than usual), and it'll look like a normal patch to you folks. You can expect these changes to be less complex in nature - no mechanics changes and easy to understand. Thinking tuning numbers to base stats, abilities, and items. Right now we're actually looking at a fairly sized chunk of champions / items, but we'll see what we end up shipping. Primary focus is on top lane/fighters, but expect changes to impact every role to varying extents. \"","replies":[{"poster":"KogaTheWolfhog","date":"2017-12-04T09:19:46.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok danke, dann bin ich mal gespannt ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BabyRageLoL","date":"2017-12-04T02:16:19.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Die Wintermap kommt meistens Mitte Dezember, wenn auch das Snowdown Event startet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrYatty","date":"2017-12-03T20:21:27.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wahrscheinlich im laufe des nächsten Patches.","replies":[]}]}
