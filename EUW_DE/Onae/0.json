I also did a printable key that could be made from three key fragments.\r\nWhen she won an S+, i gave her the box, but i didn&#039;t let her open it, i told her that i&#039;ve hidden three fragment keys in the room, and that she would only be able to open it if he found them.\r\nThere are three sizes to print, each one needs its own size paper.\r\nA4 size:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/estudios.ona/photos/a.1815449175403509.1073741828.1815405362074557/1824195917862168/?type=3&amp;theater \r\n\r\nA3 size:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/estudios.ona/photos/a.1815449175403509.1073741828.1815405362074557/1824196224528804/?type=3&amp;theater\r\n\r\nA2 size:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/estudios.ona/photos/a.1815449175403509.1073741828.1815405362074557/1824196374528789/?type=3&amp;theater\r\n\r\nWhat do u guys think about it?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll keep uploading my works, cya {{champion:18}} \r\nhttps://www.instagram.com/estudios.ona/","replies":[{"poster":"CrasherOfGaming","date":"2017-02-09T18:58:09.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey :)( The Links are down ... :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZNKT","date":"2017-01-28T23:02:05.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a cool idea!
