It starts to Lag really bad and my champ starts to teleport (worst lag movement) and it doesnt show the ATK animation.\r\nOn my last game i was hitting the tower (minions where doing DMG but atk animation was off mine too) and then it paused and the enemy was right in front of me and had taken half of my HP already.\r\nThe strange thing is that my ping was ok so i dont understand whats happening. \r\nI play on my Laptop since more than 3 months.\r\n\r\nspecifications: https://support.hp.com/ch-de/document/c05311595\r\n\r\nAs someone who understands a bit of computers i can say that it should work just fine with this intel graphic card, so that shouldn`t be the problem. As i said it worked before just fine and i dont understand why it happens and if its the Internet, i dont understand why my ping seems OK.\r\n\r\nPLS HELP","replies":[{"poster":"BigSnipe","date":"2017-05-20T02:04:17.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Du wirst sehr wahrscheinlcih einen hohen Paketverlust haben. Das kann man beheben indem man mit Lan spielt. Man kann auch einen anderen/besseren Vertrag nehemen.\nKannst du deine Grafikeinstellungen etwas anheben? ATK Animationen werden selbst durch lags ausgeführt. Jedoch wenn du alles auf Minimum stellst, könnte es sein, das man es nichtmehr so gut sieht.","replies":[{"poster":"D3ATHG","date":"2017-05-20T20:21:55.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ja es scheint tatsächlich das Internet zu sein...ab eine bestimmte Uhrzeit wird es ziemlich eklig...Danke für den Hinweis","replies":[]}]}]}
