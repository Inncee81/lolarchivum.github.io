Rather than rush a fix out the door, we are going to take due diligence to maintain the integrity of the game and release Kindred (all fixed up) next patch, once it has had adequate coverage. Until that time I hope Worlds can sustain your hype train. We really can't wait to get this champ in your hands and see what you can do with them.
