He may be Top Tier, but not broken. GP is realy hard to lane against as a non-Bruisertoplnaer but can be done bc he needs Levels, his Keg will be nerved heavily next Patch so i dont consider him a mustbann too. What leaves us with the 4 OP Champions. \nFiora, Darius and Garen are Lanebullys that only have to loose against each other. So the firstpicking team would have to Bann 3 to secure there good toplaner. Toplane will be one of those matchups, bc you just cant spend 3 banns on getting 1 Champion, if your enemy is friendly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiggyvara","date":"2015-09-14T08:12:53.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok ich fang einfach mal auf deutsch an.\nHier wird immer angeführt, dass es im kopetiven Modus und gerade in den Spielen in denen es um Geld geht zu einfach wäre jemandem seine Main-Champions weg zu bannen. \nIch kann dieses Argument immer nicht nachvollziehen.\nSchlieslich wäre dieses \"wegbannen\" bei beiden Teams der Fall, so dass eine Benachteiligung eines Teams objektiv nicht stattfinden kann.\nZweitens wäre dies vor allem für diejenigen, die mit demSpiel ihr Geld verdienen wollen halt einfach nur ein Grund sich zu diversifizieren.
