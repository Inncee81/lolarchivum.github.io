Breaking News: Flaming is wrong. No matter the situation... It doesnt help you win games, it only gets your teammates  to tilt (even harder) and it gets you banned from Ranked... nothing to gain by doing it, so stop it...\n\nAnd Ranked Restrictions aren't exactly a new invention... they exsist since last year... yet you still flamed 2 Week ago... your not \"treated wrong\", you acted wrong and now you've got to live with it...\n\nBut think positive: The fact that this restriction actually costs you... might actually stop you from flaming. Just dont do it anymore and you wont have any problems...\n\nOh... und Sauerkraut und Bratwurst...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-02-11T19:05:46.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nAs you said, you flame. So there is the reason you got the restriction. Just because you did not play doesnt mean, that you dont get a restriction.  You should consider to stop flaming, if you dont want another restriction.\nAlso this is the german forum.\n\nRkoturdo","replies":[]}]}
