That is why I decided to open this thread and to ask for your opinions and to give an idea of mine. (The question is: &quot;Do OTPs have an advantage in playing rank or not?&quot;)\r\nOut of my perspective, onetrickponys have rather a disadvantage than an advantage. There are three crunchpoints. Match-ups in early game, general fight awareness in late game, and a killer argument, which I will present later.\r\n\r\nAbout the match-ups:\r\nOnetrickponys might have played every possible match-up against their pony at least one time in their lol career, but they have to play these. They cannot just decide to play an other champ in rank, just because they would get countered. They have to play against enemy&#039;s pick. Further, statistically, they know definitely less match-ups than common players, which is obvious, because the probability for a not onetrickpony to have the same matchup twice in a row is way more lower. All in all, they got less experience in match-ups and thus in most cases rather a disadvantage than an advantage.\r\n\r\nAbout the fight awareness:\r\nOf course, a OTP is able to estimate his or her potential way more better than someone who is playing a champ which he just plays from time to time. But still, I would say, that they got less fight awareness because they ain&#039;t got the broad experience and the awareness of the different abilities of the champs of their own as well as of their enemy team. A simple example: Olaf on Top vs Panth OTP. Panth never played Olaf and randomly does not know that Olaf gets stronger the lower his hp goes. He thinks, ok I can kill him easily in the trade bcs he can estimate his own dmg. But finally he dies because he never played Olaf and didn&#039;t know about the fact that Olaf gets stronger the lower he gets. Finally, I would say, that OTPs got a neutral fight awareness. It&#039;s a mix of being able to land own abilities very good and messing up because of missing Knowledge.\r\n\r\nAbout the killer argument:\r\nThe &quot;ranking-Distribution&quot; of OTPs are mathematical significant similar to the &quot;ranking-distribution&quot; of normal players. You can compare two statistics to prove that. First, take the list &quot;Champion Enthusiasts&quot; from _lolskill.net_ on the EUW server and count the number of players on the list and calculate percentages of each league. I started to count with a program at the 6001 OTP on the list bcs the first 6000 would distort the data bcs they are playing way more league than an average leagueplayer does. And thus they are obviously in average higher ranked than the average. You will find out, that the distribution for the first 20.000 players, starting with the 6001, is:\r\n\r\nBronze = 39% (rounded)\r\nSilver = 37% (rounded)\r\nGold = 15% (rounded)\r\nPlatin = 7% (rounded)\r\nDiamond = 1.94%\r\nMaster = 0.04%\r\nChallenger = 0.02%\r\n\r\nAnd this is very similar to \r\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution/euw\r\nwhich compares all players together without distinguishing between OTPs and normal players. That is why I think it is apparent that OTPs do not have an advantage over the not-OTPs!\r\n\r\nDoubts?\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for my english, I am not a native speaker.","replies":[{"poster":"Nycaria","date":"2017-02-24T04:20:43.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2017-02-24T06:30:09.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Warum auch immer das leute mit dem deutschen Forum nicht checken ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"DanionVibit","date":"2017-02-24T06:05:13.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This are the german boards but i can give you my thoughts about otps. \n\nI was last season an Aurelion OTP or more an TTP with Jhin. I must say last season was my climax in LoL. As OTP (or TTP) you can learn even more macro play then ever before and I was able to hit Platin last season. If you have a champion that makes so much fun that you decide to be an OTP so do it. \n\nOn the other hand you arent able to play another champ decent or good. But in most cases you are able to \"out-macro\" the enemy team =)","replies":[]}]}
