We recently turned this feature on with the 5.8 deploys, and shortly after started receiving a handful of tickets for players who were on the team of someone who purchased the skin boost not receiving a random skin (IP was received though).\nAfter doing some digging, our engineers found a bug in the code where some messages around status of Skin Boosts weren't able to communicate with each other inside our platform hardware. We are in the process of fixing the bug, but due to the nature of the fix will be holding off on deploying it until the next release (5.9). Sorry for the inconvenience!\n04/29/2015\nNetwork Operations — The Skin Boost system has been temporarily disabled.\n\nNachzulesen auch hier: http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#euw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Die gute Mungo","date":"2015-05-14T05:14:34.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"ka aber is echt nervig\ndie Server spacken auch grad und hauen einen oft aus dem game raus und verweigern dann den reconnect","replies":[{"poster":"High im Seb","date":"2015-05-14T06:38:33.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KaputzenMungo\n\nEUW bekommt grade den Patch 4.9 aufgespielt und deshalb sind die Server offline ;)\n\nLG Sebastian  -  SebPlayZz\n\nFear is the path to the dark side of the Force  -  Master Yoda \n──────────────────────  \n────────┌┴┴┐──────────  \n────▀▀█═╡▀▀╞═█▀▀──────  \n────────└╥╥┘──────────  \n─────────╝╚───────────","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GripsGaming","date":"2015-05-14T05:43:41.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EUW ist wieder online!","replies":[]}]}
