I had the same issues like you with the same champion, seems magic. :D\nWhen I started trying to get these lvl 6 tokens for him I was really surprised because I had some games in which I had 2/1/22 or something like that, a high KDA. But when I got for example 4-5 Kills in the game with 0-1 Deaths and many assists, I got my tokens.\nI don't say that you should take every kill now but just for the tokens you could take 1 or 2 kills more.^^\n\nGood luck in hunting those sweet tokens!\nP.S.: This is the wrong forum, you are in the german one. : )","replies":[{"poster":"II InsâneCat II","date":"2016-06-06T17:14:22.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh dachte man muss trotzdem auf englisch schreiben ?!

Any \"breakpoint\" you had yesterday may be obsolete tomorrow or vice versa.","replies":[]}]}
