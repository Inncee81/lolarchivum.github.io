I played main mid but idk, its not so fun anymore and I really like the top champs I mentioned and imo every of the three is fun to play.

Imo more than Irelia. But Irelia is good in big tf's.\nJust try out both tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirtr0lal0t","date":"2019-10-17T03:35:19.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how much you want to interact with your team I guess. \nIrelia is the best teamfighter off of these champs in my opinion while fiora is the worst.\nI say Camille is best at split pushing, while fiora is best at 1 vs 1. \nWhy not play all 3? Maybe even add Jax?\nIf you are new to top lane I say play Camille, because she is probably the easiest to play and the hardest to punish. As long as you don't go aggressive yourself, you'll be pretty much unkillable.","replies":[]}]}
