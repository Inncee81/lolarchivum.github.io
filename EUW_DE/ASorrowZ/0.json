(xD) \r\nIts a serious thing I&#039;m trying to tell Riot.\r\nI don&#039;t understand why you aka Riot don&#039;t remove Aftershock from Assassins mode like you did with Unsealed Spellbook.\r\nWhy am I asking? Cause I just played 16-17 games of Camille with that rune and the most tanky items I could find and got a pretty steady kda. But whats really crazy is that I had most damage, most tanked, no one could 1vs1 me in almost all of these games. Oh btw I had a 80% winrate.\r\nI don&#039;t know if thats considered &quot;op&quot;... Buuuuuut I think yes, because assassins should get coutnered by tanks aaaaaand with that rune + build + champ... Youre basically a Tank. Land your E and you&#039;re unkillable - there are enought items that give you some ok stats like Hextrinker and Ninjatabis so this rune pops off and makes you unkillable even for Kha or Kayn. Q true damage - you killed them and youre still half Hp even when they spamed 2 full rotations of abilitys onto you. Then maybe you use youre R to dodge something or lock them down and you won.\r\n\r\nTo be honest thats it. I love camille and I had so much fun in these ~20 games but it felt too op for me to play a TANK in the ASSASSIN MODE. So I wanted to post it in the boards. (Do with the information what you want. I may be the first one to be so stupid and try to take a tank rune in an assassin mode. So this will prob. get no upvotes cause it doesn&#039;t sound that op or some crazy bug ooooh. But yeah...)","replies":[{"poster":"Alekra","date":"2018-02-17T14:11:05.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im Forum treiben sich keine Riotmitglieder rum nur andere Spieler","replies":[{"poster":"ASorrowZ","date":"2018-02-17T22:40:15.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad life\nBut thanks...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ASorrowZ","date":"2018-02-17T22:39:39.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad life","replies":[]}]}]}
