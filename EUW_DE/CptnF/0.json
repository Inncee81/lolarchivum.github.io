This is probably gonna take a few tries\r\n- The sufficient augments. As far as i have seen so far, 4x Yas with Temperst and Wandering and 1 Malph with Relentless and Onslaught seems to be the easiest way to do the mission. You should be able to play with these setups. Im open for other comps though. \r\n\r\nAdd me.
