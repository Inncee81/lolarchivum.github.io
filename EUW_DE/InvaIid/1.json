It was just detectable because of the changing of the background (\"gravity field\") if you know what i mean. As you can imagine thats quite hard to find and so we were quite unable to dodge it. \r\nPlease fix this bug and deactive lux as long as the fix holds on because thats really unfair.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"19Fuzzo92","date":"2015-03-21T23:31:32.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hallo...\nich habe gerade eben auch gegen **Lux** gespielt und diesen Bug kann ich bestätigen.\nHatten keine Chance denn das **E** konnte man nicht sehn.\nEs war nur etwas verschwommen und plötzlich traf es einen.\n\nDer Spieler hatte dabei keinen **Skin**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tiaryn","date":"2015-02-18T14:54:53.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hatte die Lux einen bestimmten Skin?","replies":[]}]}
