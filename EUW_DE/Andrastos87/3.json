Flick is red and Mina yellow. They move hopping and dancing in a playful manner.\n\n__________________________________\n\n**Lore:**\n\nDon&#039;t go in the swamp at night,\nwhen the lights are shining bright!\nDo&#039;nt follow them into the haze,\nor you will be set ablaze.\nBut if you are lost on your track\njust stay calm and don&#039;t look back\nThe shining lights will guide your path\nif your heart is kind and without wrath.\n\nEvery child in Valoran knows about this poem and because of that most of them listen and don&#039;t go near swamps at night.\n\nWill-o&#039;-the-wisps are little firespirits that need to posess flammable objects which they consume, like sticks or leaves.\n\nBut Flick and Mina are different than the other will-o&#039;-the-wisps. Once a wandering mage caught sight of the two dancing spirits and followed them into the swamp, where he got hoplessly lost. When the two of them finally noticed the mage, it was already too late. He fell into a mudpool and never saw the surface again.\nThe only things that floated to the surface again, where his hat and a magical amulett.\n\nFlick and Mina understood that this amulett would be of great benefit to them and so they possesed it. It broke in two, so both of them had a part of it. The magic of the amulet feeded them and amplified their natural magic powers greatly.\n\nAfter some time a search-and-rescue-team entered the swamp in search of the missing mage. They found Flick and Mina and recognized the amulett they where possessing. They tried to retrieve it, but Flick and Mina gave them a taste of their new magic.\n\nThey decided that this amount of magic power was way too much for such simple beings without control, so they catched them and put them into the league of legends.\n\n______________________________\n\n**Abilites:**\n\n**Passiv: Will O the wisp&#039;s dance**\nWhenever they use an ability, they will switch places and all of their abilites will switch too. The cooldowns of the abilites is not influenced by this place-exchange.\n\n _When switching, the whole ability-list switches too._\n\n\n**Q- Abilities:**\n\n**Flick: Follow us**\n(Skillshot)\nmakes the two of them dash straight forward and leaving behind a trail of small magic fires, that heal allies who touch them and damage enemies for magic damage.\n\n**Mina: Up high**\nmakes the two fly in the air in a spiral, taking all enemies in meelee-range with them for 1 second and dealing them magic damage.\n\n_The range of &bdquo;Follow us&ldquo; is 800. The magical damage of the flames is  65/100/140/180/200 +20% ability power and they heal for 25/50/75/110/130 +15% ability power.\n&bdquo;Up high&ldquo; deals 60/100/130/150/170 +30% AP magical damage_\n\n**W-Abilities**\n\n**Flick: Tricked**\ncreates a short-living copy of an allied champion or Flick and Mina themselves, which does no damage. If the copy is attacked, it bursts and deals magic damage to the attacker and stuns him for 1 second.\n\n**Mina: Fooled**\n creates a copy of a minion or tower which can attack with a little of the originals power. If the copy is attacked, it will burst and will slow the attacker down for 20% (2 seconds).\n\n_the copy of &bdquo;Tricked&ldquo; lives for 2 seconds. If she is destroyed, she deals 35/70/110/140/180 +20% AP magical damage to the destroyer.\nThe copy of Fooled lives for 5/5,5/6/6,5/7 seconds._\n\n**E-Abilities**\n\n**Flick: Flare**\n(Skillshot)\nwill shoot a trail of fire in a chosen direction, which deals magic damage to all enemies hit\n\n**Mina: Flash**\nwill send out a bright flash of light, which blinds nearby enemies.\n\n_The range of &bdquo;Flare&ldquo; is 925, the damage is 70/100/150/180/220 +30% AP.\nThe range of &bdquo;Flash&ldquo; is as high as the range of Sona&#039;s auras_\n\n**R-Ultimative-Ability**\n\n**Flick: Wild dance**\nmakes the two spin around a center. While doing so the distance between them will grow bigger. Enemies between them will take magical damage continously. During this skill Flick and Mina will move 20% slower, but can move through units and are immune to slowing-effects.\n\n**Mina: Kiss**\nwill fuse the two together to a giant ball of fire. In this form they will move 20% faster and get true sight. They will shoot little flames at enemies and allies alike, favorising champions. These fires deal magic damage to enemies and heal allies.\n\n_]The range of &bdquo;Wild dance&ldquo; increases from meelee-range to 600. The damage is 80/110/150 +20% AP per second.\n&bdquo;Kiss&ldquo; lasts for 4/5/6 seconds and deals 60/100/140 +25% AP magical damage and heals for 30/80/130 +20% AP.\nThe shooting range of the little flames is 500/550/600, their shooting frequency is 120/150/175% of the own attack-speed._\n\n\n_______________________________\n\nLive: XX X\nDamage: X\nMagic: XX XX\nDifficulty: XX XX\n__________________________\n\n\n**Champion spotlights**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9CQjFHcdCKJSWQZ_kiitQ6xz9MDcFXvV\n\n_________________________\n\n\n**Forum**\n\n**Zai&#039;Xin**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2056961\n**Flash**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=18304769#post18304769\n**Hoketi**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=18143294#post18143294\n**Hachielle**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=17970620#post17970620\n**Chiro**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=17815573#post17815573\n**Fienna**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=17772296#post17772296\n**Gnorre**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=17517445#post17517445\n**Mr. Lickets:**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1862601&highlight=snorki\n**Snorki:**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1845704&highlight=snorki","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2015-04-28T16:54:21.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion suggestion and spotlight are nicely done and the kit seems interesting and fun to play around with.\n---\nSome things that bother me a bit (feel free to ignore):\nWhy do you post both versions in the [german forum](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/de/c/skin-champion-konzepte-de) ? And not [seperate](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-creations-en) ?\nThe W abilities are kinda strange.
