Legends tell of a creature of the void, big as a castle, which could devour whole villages and which could lay thousands of eggs, of which smaller, but way greedier versions of itself hatched.\n\nLed by one of Master Yi's ancestors, the army of Ionia faced the monstrosity and after a battle which last for 3 nights and 3 days, the creature and all of her offsprings where killed.\n\nWith but one exeption. A young girl, Karma's own great-grandmother could not kill a nearly harmless baby living being and she convinced the adults to lock the last offspring away behind stone and seals.\n\nGenerations of Karma's family watched over that creature and they gave it the name „Zai'Xin“, what means „great mother“. Because shortly after it was locked away, the creature grew to a multitude of it's size and countless eggs grew on its back, eager to hatch and eat.\n\nOne night Cho'Gath and Kog'Maw started an escape-plan. While Kog'Maw drew the attention of the Inionian to himself, cho'Gath did break the seals and freed Zai'Xin of her prison. He took her to the league of legends, because she needs the best food for her brood and there she could find the very best food of Runeterra.\n\n\n______________________________\n\n**Abilites:**\n\n**Passiv: Flesh and blood**\nWhenever one of Zai'Xin's Brood dies, she gets 10% increased attack and movement-speed for 2 seconds. This effect stacks to a maximum of 70%.\n\n*Whenever one of the Brood dies, the acitve timer resets. With some luck she can have strongly increased speeds for nearly 10 seconds or more.*\n\n**Q-Ability: Eggshot**\nFires an egg in a target area. The egg has live points, grants a little sight and after 5 seconds a brood hatches, if Zai'Xin is close to the egg.\n\nThe brood follow Zai'Xin and attack targets at meelee, which are attacked by Zin'Xai. They have live points and can evolve when the ult is used.\n\nThe attacks of the brood don't apply hit-effects. Zai'Xin can have a maximum of 4 brood at once.\n\n*If 3 brood stay close to each other, they lose all collision, what means, that units can move through them.\n\nThe range of the Eggshot is great, comparable to Corki's Phosphorus-Bomb, the range in which she has to stay for the eggs to hach is comparable to the attack-range of Heimerdinger's towers.\nThe cooldown of this skill is 5 Seconds, but doesn't go down with skill level. But live and damage of the brood rises. Effects that affect Zai'Xin's movement-speed, also apply to the brood, effects that apply to her attack speed, apply to 25% the brood.\nThe Brood have 200/300/400/500/600 +20% of Zai'Xin's additional live as livepoints, 5/10/15/20/30 armor and magic resistance and on each level 50 attack damage.\n\nThe hatch time of the eggs is not influenced by cooldown-reducing effects.*\n\n**W-Ability: Eat!**\nFires a lump of flesh on a target enemy or egg. The Brood attack the target for 4 seconds, even if Zai'Xin attacks the same target or not or if she moves away from it. If the brood attack an egg, they will get healed. If she activates the ability again, the brood will stop attacking the target and run back to her.\n\n*If the brood destroy an egg, they will be healed for 50% of their maximum live. If Zai'Xin moves away from the brood, they will run after her, when the effect ends. But if she teleports back to base, the brood will stop their attack and teleport with her.*\n\n**E-Ability: Parasite jump**\nZai'Xin and her brood jump at a target enemy or egg, deal physical damage and apply a parasite which reveals the target for 4 seconds. If the target dies while under the effect of this skill, it will leave an egg. If an egg is the target, it will hatch immediately.\n\n*The range of this skill is lower than the range of Tristana's jump.*\n\n**R-Ult: Egg cascade**\nZai'Xin fires a salvo of eggs in a target area. The eggs explode after 0,5 seconds, dealing normal damage. If Xai'zin has not the full number of Brood, Brood will hatch from the eggs.\nEvery Level of this skill increases the maximum number of Brood and hatchet brood by 1 to a maximum of 7 Brood and decreases the hatch time by 1 second to a minimum of 2 seconds.\nFrom this skill 2/3/4 Brood will hatch from the eggs, but only until she has the full number of brood.\n\nIf this skill is used, all Brood evolve in one out of three forms. Even out of old eggs, evolved Brood will hatch. If the skill is used again, the evolution can be changed.\n\n*if the skill is used, the other spells will be replaced by the 3 choice-fields of the Brood-evolutions, if a skill is used, the evolution is chosen and the Brood will evolve. The damage of the skill is very low for an ult and it scales barely.*\n\n\n**Q: Shadowbrood**\nEvolves the Brood to Shadowbrood, with a short ranged, physical auto-attack and with increased armor and magic resistance. If the Brood dies, it explodes and leaves a Shadowessence, that will heal Zai'Xin, if she walks over it.\n\n*The range of the Brood autoattack rises with Ult-Skilllevel. The Brood has additional 5%, 10%, 20% of Zai'Xin's armor and magic resistance and the Shadowessence heals her for 2%, 4%, 5% of her maximum health.*\n\n**W: Acidbrood**\nEvolves the Brood to Acidbrood, that don't attack, but have an aura that deals physical damage per second to nearby enemies. If these Brood die, they will reveal nearby enemies.\n\n*The effect of the damage-aura can be stacked, Towers and buildings only receive 25% of the aura-damage. The damage of the Aura is 10+ 2%, 5%, 10% of Zin'Xai's attack damage and is dealt every second as physical damage. The explosion of the Brood makes enemys in meelee range visible, reveals them for 2/3/4 seconds.*\n\n**Coldbrood**\nEvolves the Brood to Coldbrood, which deal magical meelee damage and apply a slowing effect on targets, if the Coldbrood die, they explode and root enemies in meelee-range for 1 second.\n\n*The enemies get slowed by 2%, 5%, 10%, this effect can stack up to a maximum of 70%. The magical damage this brood deals is 5+ 2%, 5%, 8% of Zai'Xin's ability power.*\n\n_______________________________\n\nLive: XX X\nDamage: XX X\nMagic: XX X\nDifficulty: XX X\n__________________________\n\n\n**Champion spotlights**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9CQjFHcdCKJSWQZ_kiitQ6xz9MDcFXvV\n\n_________________________\n\n\n**Forum**\n\n**Flash**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...9#post18304769\n**Hoketi**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...4#post18143294\n**Hachielle**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...0#post17970620\n**Chiro**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...3#post17815573\n**Fienna**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...6#post17772296\n**Gnorre**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...5#post17517445\n**Mr. Lickets:**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...ghlight=snorki\n**Snorki:**\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.co...ghlight=snorki","replies":[{"poster":"beatbug","date":"2017-11-05T12:01:54.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ich sehe das gerade 3 jahre nachdem du es gemacht hast und ich sehe das du damals schon die Idee vom jetzigen Malzahar hattest :D\nAber sonst ganz guter Champ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"leonb2211","date":"2015-02-07T07:52:17.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice champion!","replies":[{"poster":"Andrastos87","date":"2015-02-07T08:56:48.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you very much, please like and share ;)","replies":[]}]}]}
