Usually I just turn on some instrumental music (guitar e.g.) or, as dumb as it sounds, kinda \"depressiv\" music or sth. not quite sure how to descirbe it (e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1uevDKA14Y). Which really stop me from getting tilted, whem I'm already in-game. \nBut when you wan't to stop getting tilted, because you don't get in-game. I'd just start a custom game every day on, until it works. (If the problem also appears there) You can also download the Hextech Repair Tool (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/de/articles/224826367-Automatisierte-Fehlerbehebung-Hextech-Repair-Tool), which might help you solving the problem (if you haven't already opened a ticket to the Riot Support yet (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/de/requests/new))\nAs long as you've got that problem I recommend watching YouTube, Twitch or Netflix, Amazon Prime etc. (Free test month should help you there)\n\nThere are also a lot more games you can play besides League of Legends. But starting a new game when you want to play another game probably isn't the best idea.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SicKPeaL","date":"2019-11-04T04:38:38.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50NdPawLVY)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LootAndPillage","date":"2019-11-03T19:54:20.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImagineWeapons,realm=EUW,application-id=KYnfKGf0,discussion-id=IjEQJLAF,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-03T19:36:01.535+0000)\n>\n> ...
