One of our players had issues to connect to the game in our first tournament beta match.\r\nIngame we tried to use /pause, but even after our whole team and some enemies (after asking them) used the command it just didn&#039;t pause.\r\nSo we voted to remake the game. Our player that had the issues is currently restarting his computer, the rest of us is stuck in the queue without finding a game.\r\n\r\nIs any Rioter here that can help us to restart the game once he&#039;s there?
