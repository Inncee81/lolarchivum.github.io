No. And they even cant run away because they have no jump...\nAzir got a great utility. He is not a laner or 1on1 champ and in a teamfight there should be more crowd control then Azir's ultimate.\nSo no need for the knock up on an escape ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Nelford","date":"2015-08-21T14:06:45.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then the ability should be changed. Why even need a shield if connects with an enemy champ? I reckon they should change it so he darts to a target location (the mouse) and leaves a soldier where he was standing. No longer a 2 move escape and give some interesting new dynamics.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rpgboss","date":"2015-07-22T15:33:11.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"azir need kock up .","replies":[{"poster":"Tecnica","date":"2015-07-22T16:02:46.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir just got a 20% as buff on his W. This really does compensate his weaker early. The problem about a good Azir was, that he had no weak phase during the game + that his lategame was wayyy to strong for his early range+poke+mana value+survivabitly+cc. Previous he was able to poke and kill an enemy on lane as a hardcore lategame champ. Now you finally need to care a bit (still not enough imo) about your positioning while farming.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Killthestyle","date":"2015-07-22T15:47:43.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowgen","date":"2015-07-22T15:18:38.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shurima{{champion:268}}","replies":[]}]}
