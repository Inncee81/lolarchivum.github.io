I have her on mastery level 6 and want to get her to 7, obviously. I had a lot of good games tbh, but this one was the pinnacle of troll. We had 35 kills ind 29 mins and I finished the game with 0-0-24. And i got an S- for that, how does this work on supports, I just dont get it. It feels so random sometimes. I had some games with braum where I was like 2-6-30 and got an S and then on this nami game I dont get it. Can anyone explain some things that come into the calculation on what grade you get when playing supports? ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Azima","date":"2017-05-12T09:05:41.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reached Lv 7 with Nami ~last week.\n1: 3/0/17 (31 Kills; 27minutes) + 18 wards + 7 destroyed wards  + 3 control wards + 13 CS\n2: 4/0/16 (29 Kills; 24minutes) + 13 wards + 0 destroyed wards + 2 control wards + 5 CS\n3: 2/4/29 (43 Kills, 33minutes) + 23 wards + 4 destroyed wards + 3 control wards + 24 CS\n\nIn the end it was enough to get her to LV 7. With Lulu and Karma it was almost the same. \nMaybe you didnt get the S because you had no kills. As I tried to get Janna on LV 7, I remember one game where I was 0/0/38 and it was an S- .\nFew games later I was 3/1/32 and I got my S/ S+ -_-  For me as Support it feels horrible to try to get kills. If it happens, well okay. But it feels that you are forced to get kills.\n I think an 0/0/38 Support is way better than someone who played 3/1/32. \n\nI guess for an S on Nami you should try to get 3 or 4 Kills, try not to die and get assists as much as you can. Thats just the sad way it is ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"ยบ Kindred ยบ","date":"2017-05-06T11:04:21.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it you need to place more wards, and even so absurd it sounds, you also need to take some kills. Thats how i got atleast my supports at lvl 7\nEDIT: they alost compare you with other nami players in your elo. That means that u have to play alot better than the other nami players.","replies":[{"poster":"Chizzl McNuggets","date":"2017-05-06T12:35:43.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"28 wards placed in that game, their karma only put down 17, so I think that shouldnt be the problem. \nBut I didnt know that comparison was actually a thing, thanks for the info{{champion:267}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chizzl McNuggets","date":"2017-05-06T12:36:59.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo can you tell me what vision score means exactly?","replies":[{"poster":"Allerbester Biss","date":"2017-05-06T17:07:38.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk whether you already know \"P i n k  W a r d s\"\nBut they are pretty important as well\n\nAnd 28 wards in like 29min are way not enough \nTy","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
