Recap said his [Q] dealt 1,2k magic damage with one hit, the rest of my HP have been taken away by his previous [E], which was approx. 1/4 of my HP.\nI was kinda surprised, because I remembered his [Q] is a 3 hit spell now, which I remembered not to be that strong, especially because he didn&#039;t have any kind of a Sheen proc. \nAnyway, he killed me with 3/4 HP and one 1 Q(the first strike), obviously.\n\nWhat&#039;s that?\nI mean, I heard Mordekaiser is strong by now, but 1,2k dmg with the first hit of this [Q] spell, that has a max CD of 10s, seems pretty weird to me.\nEspecially when being level 10 and not fed at all.\n\nAnyway, that left me with jaw dropped and confused.\nWas that some kind of bug, that I should report, or is that normal?\n\nJust curious! {{item:2050}}","replies":[{"poster":"RosaroterTeddy","date":"2015-10-17T19:53:51.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Der erste Hit sollte extrem wenig Schaden machen, so ca aa+20,30 oder so, der zweite hit ist dann der erste x 3 und der dritte hit ist dann op, nämlich der zweite nochmal x 3. Es kann gut sein dass er das gegen Minions aufgebaut hat und dich dann nur einmal, mit dem letzten Hit, getroffen hat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bergelmir32","date":"2015-10-17T18:51:00.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are there currently so many people that see a hole website in german, press two buttons also with german language and than still thinking they are at the english board?\n\nOder Variante Nummer 2: Warum glauben Leute das jemand der kein Deutsch kann auch nur einen Blick ins deutsche Forum wirft, in der Hoffnung da irgendjemanden zu finden der zufällig einen Thread in Englisch erstellt hat?","replies":[{"poster":"DrChaaos","date":"2015-10-17T18:58:59.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naja, ich habe das Forum über google geöffnet, und das erstbeste genommen.\nUnd bisher war das meistens ein englisches.\n:D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MordeEsNumeroUN0","date":"2015-10-17T18:53:22.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HueHueHUe","replies":[]},{"poster":"xBlitzlichTx","date":"2015-10-17T18:52:12.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey :)\nYou are in the german forums.
