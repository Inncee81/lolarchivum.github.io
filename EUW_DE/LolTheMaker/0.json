I am in Bronze V ahahaha youll think but I really dont think I belong down there and just got down cause of bad Team. I now that many use this excuse for bronze 5 but i really think that i dont belong down there. So here is what really finishes me. I started to push up from 0 lp in bronze 5 til 100 in a week I made aproximately 7 Rankeds and I won every ranked game till 100 lp. I never lost. and now the best comes...... I fought like wow man now I'm gonna be out of bronze 5 into 4 but then it came. In the first game of my promotion series We won but only very close cause i was fed. But in the 2. one I had a jungler that was afk and cause the jungler was akt my top laner trolled the whole time and fed enemy teemo. I lost that game. I thought like okay took a breath and played the 3rd game and again my team didnt coop together and I lost the game. So i was was on 70 Lp again. Then i thought okay this can happen yolo. So i played agani up to 100 Lp in to games . I won both. and now I had 1 free win. 2st game I was kata and was fed again but I lost cause of my team again. in 3rd Game it was again the same I was adc ezreal total fed with 14 kills and 6 deaths but my tem fed and fed and I lost again. So now my question how can this be that I won every dumb ranked game while pushing up to 100 Lp and suddenly when I get to promos i have the biggest noob/troll team? I just don't understand this cause I never fed myself and always had good kda. Can someone help pls thx","replies":[{"poster":"ü ö","date":"2016-02-17T07:08:46.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warum belügst du dich selbst?\n\n0-8-5 als ADC\n2-9-0 als Mid\n2-10-6 als ADC\n\nDazu schrecklichen Farm mit zB 57 (!!) in 24 Minuten, oder 129 (als ADC!) in 38 Minuten. \nSogar deine Builds sind fragwürdig (Trinity UND Gauntlet auf Ezreal, uneffektiv wegen 2 Sheens.) \n\nDie Wahrheit ist zwar hart, aber momentan bist du einfach Bronze und dass du \"immer gute KDA's\" hast ist einfach eine ganz dicke Lüge. Du wurdest in deiner Promotion mit 2-10 gecarriet (der \"free win\" wie du selber sagst) und regst dich dann auf dass **du leute die so wie du im Spiel vorher gespielt haben nicht carrien konntest?** Genau richtig gelesen, **du** bist Schuld an B5, nicht die Teams, nur du. \n\nFang damit an deinen CS zu verbessern, das ist wohl das einfachste.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Call me Br00t","date":"2016-02-16T17:14:54.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong forum dude ;)\n\nIt's the German one here","replies":[]},{"poster":"LolTheMaker","date":"2016-02-16T19:32:35.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shit ich dachte ich muss extra Englisch schreiben dass es jemand versteht -.- xD","replies":[]}]}
