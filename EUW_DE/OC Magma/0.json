Of course you could griefe than but however, when you are in the middle of a game and random dude has a dc or just goes afk. Why should&#039;nt you than do a remake? Duos could griefe out of this but it would only be a penalty. They lost a shit load of time and they only get prevented from a lose. However if this function woudl be in the late game you than however should have the option the report somebody if they used this for their own advantge like preventing from a lose in a promo. But is&#039;nt  it to frustrating just sitting there and not be able to do anything because one of your team is afk?","replies":[{"poster":"Angel Ayume","date":"2017-05-31T23:57:35.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"German Forum my Boy.","replies":[]}]}
