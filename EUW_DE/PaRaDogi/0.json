I am forced to go sup items in jungle to get the wards later but they arent even worth since the stats they give are useless late game and it uses a whole slot for a much better item its actualy realy anoying.\r\n\r\nLee was already a weak champion that is only decent on good leesin players.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that creating a personal item for lee like viktor has.\r\nWich you can upgrade in 3 diffrent stages.\r\nyou get this item for free from beginn as a passiv and its can have a condition like at 10 min your item evolves in to a warding item then this item can be upgrade in 2 ways: AD and Tank.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 min for 1000 gold you can upgrade to warding item + some ad or warding item + some health\r\nFor 2500 gold more ad or more health and for 3000 gold last upgrade: i think this way of fixing lee problems with his wards is decent but it needs the right balancing from the balancing team &quot;snezze&quot; &quot;balance&quot; but if you dont do anything to fix the problem for lee he will be useless and boring to play.","replies":[{"poster":"HanLess","date":"2018-02-27T21:55:02.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole ward problem could be easily solved by reworking his W into a skillshot dash so he can finally use wards for warding and meanwhile make plays like before especially when sightstone and the warding jng item got removed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeMyselfandBaal","date":"2018-02-27T18:30:43.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"since you're a Lee Sin Main: Have you tried Relic Shield as that Special Item?

Die Vorteile gegenüber anderen Champs sind einfach zu groß (deutlich mehr Vision als bspw. der gegnerische Jungler, ein AD-/Health-Item mehr als alle anderen,.....)","replies":[]}]}
