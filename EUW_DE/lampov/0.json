I thought a lot about this and came to the end that i would make a lot of changes. So, here they are:\r\nQ: Javelin Toss: I would increase the AP-ratio from 40% to 50%\r\nQ: Takedown: I would deacrease the AP-ratio from 36% to 20% and increase the AD-ratio from 75% to 90%, because i think that Nidalee shouldnt be able to oneshot people with a combo in her cougar form without the Passive (she can do this sometimes if she is a little ahead and has Lichbane)\r\nW: Pounce: I would change the cooldown from 5 sec to 7/6/6.5/5 seconds (the cooldown goes down by leveling up R)\r\nE: Primal Surge: I would increase the base heal from 45/85/125/165/205 health to 75/125/175/225/275 and lower the AP-ratio from 50% to 35%.\r\n\r\nThis would be the changes i would make to balance her, she would be able to be played in both styles AD-Bruiser and AP-Mage like it was said in the champion spotlight, which is old but it still counts, right?\r\nI like to see what you guys think so please tell me your ideas to balance Nidalee.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Mage","date":"2015-04-07T16:49:01.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Deutsches Forum...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThanhSon","date":"2015-04-07T18:08:00.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ganz ehrlich, ÃœBERALL IST DIE DEUTSCHE SPRACHE HIER IM FORUM VERTRETEN; OBEN LINKS STEHT DEUTSCH; WAS IST HIER LOS; CAPS IST COOL","replies":[]}]}
