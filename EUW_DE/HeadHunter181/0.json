I think thats pretty obvious because with his reworked passive he is a harder facerollchamp that Katarina. \r\nThe best way to get rid of this is to put a cd on his passive so he cant perma cc u anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Infevo","date":"2015-06-07T15:11:00.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently Kat works in every elo or else I wouldn't keep banning her in plat every game. If a team has little to no cc Kat is just gonna destroy you once her team forces you to group.\nAlso if your midlaner has no lane control and doesn't let her push and/or your jungler is too stupid to free kill her early in case she overextends.\n\nPretty much every team fight ends in a disaster if she gets some items (regardless of elo bracket). Even with instant hard cc people for some reason hesitate to pay attention or use it properly when she goes in.\n\nJust ban her. Ban Ryze.
