But riot you could do something like give them a focking temporal ban or something. Why is it that i have to wait one and a half hours to play one goddamn ranked game? If you don&#039;t do something about this, many of us are gonna stop playing even if we don&#039;t want to. There&#039;ll be one day where the most of us are gonna make this decision. You could stop that if you do something about this irritating thing called &quot;leaving&quot;.
