I wanted to play a ranked match, and i had to choose my roles. Usually i pick Bot and Mid, but this time i felt like filling. One problem was though, that i am really not the best jungler. I thought to myself, whatever, the chance of getting jungle isnt high anyways. But, as you might expect, i got jungle. Every other lane wouldve been okay, but i really suck in jungling, and i kinda caused the loss for my team. I wonder if it would be possible to create a so called &quot;Fill except&quot; button, so that you can pick fill, except for example jungle. Problems like that wouldnt happen anymore then. Pls tell me about your opinion about this guys. :)","replies":[{"poster":"The Real SLeYgA","date":"2016-07-24T18:30:30.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Welcome to the German boards!
