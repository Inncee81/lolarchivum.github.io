As you see in the title,I and a friend of mine wanted to do a BotLane Tournament. Therefore we are searching for people who want to join. It&acute;s mostly for fun and a bit practice but you can even win something.\n\n1st place = 1 Skin for the Champion you`ve won the Tournament with. You can freely choose which skin.\n\n2nd place = 1 Skin for the Champion you`ve last played in the Tournament. You can`t choose this one tho.\n\n3th place = 1 Mystery Skin\n\nEven though you`ve lost a game it`s not over, you`ll face other people until we have a certain placement, so you still can play some games against other people.\nNow to the minor rules. It`s played on Summoners Rift in Draft Mode (So make sure to have at least 16 playable champions). Since it is a BotLane you`ll start on the same lane BUT you are allowed to take objectives like drake, Baron ect.\nAlso something important to mention, since the meaning behind this Tournament is training BotLanes you are only allowed to play ranged AD as ADC:\n\n{{champion:22}}  {{champion:51}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}}  {{champion:222}}  {{champion:429}} {{champion:96}}  {{champion:236}}  {{champion:21}}  {{champion:133}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}}  {{champion:6}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:67}} \n\nThe Support may choose whatever Champion he/she wants to play BUT the Support is not allowed to build PURE DMG. Therefore you are only allowed to get those Items:\n\n{{item:3340}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3092}} {{item:1054}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3075}} {{item:2139}} {{item:2138}} {{item:2137}} {{item:2140}} {{item:3361}} {{item:3362}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3060}} {{item:2041}} {{item:3364}} {{item:2043}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3026}} {{item:2045}}{{item:3363}}  {{item:3240}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3342}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3512}} \n\nA little thing i should add you may NOT change your partner after you&acute;ve played your first game, also you need to keep your role. To make things faster we match up people who have time at the same time periods.\n\nIf you want to join write a Message or add either Neutschgy or Critalis.\n\nA small thing i nearly forgot! Punishment for rule breakers ...\nIf you are a Support and build Rabadons as first item (example)  you need to sell it, otherwise the tournament ends for you and the enemy has won the game. Me and Neutschgy will watch all games so this won`t happen. If you are unsure  about an item just ask. Also if you bought an item without knowing it`s banned and got kills through it, you need to sell it first, and the enemy is allowed to do as many kills as you got through that item.\n\nThe tournament will start as soon as we have enough participants. (Around 15 pairs)","replies":[{"poster":"Boph Teífong","date":"2015-08-10T05:31:51.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'd like to participate, probably with a friend of mine.\nMy IGN is \"Boph Teífong\" and my partner's IGN will probably be \"Fakerinooo\".\n\nThanks for bringing in innovation in this form by the way. I think this makes League more exciting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4vs1","date":"2015-07-29T09:26:11.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when is the tournament ","replies":[{"poster":"FuzzyCritalis","date":"2015-07-29T13:56:34.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends. When we got around 15 people who join we`ll make a certain time for everyone. And by the looks so far it`ll take a bit time till we have enough who want to join ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
