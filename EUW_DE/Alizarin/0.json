If u are in a bush or in stealth u can jump on enemies, if u go our of the bush or lose stealth because of dmg or and autoattack u have still 0.5 Seconds (i am not that sure about the time) time to jump on enemies.\nIn your example: Rengar used Q on Diana without jumping, then Diana flashed away within 0.5 Seconds and so he was able to jump.","replies":[{"poster":"Alizarin","date":"2015-08-29T12:24:16.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so that worked because I didn't jump when I first hit her? I still had my jump ready and it triggered when she flashed away? Hm... Didn't know that worked with the ult as well, thank you for the answer. :D","replies":[]}]}]}
