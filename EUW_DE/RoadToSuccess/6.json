Because of this I want to share the whole process via twitch. I want to prove to everyone that it is possible to reach what you aim for by just dedicating yourself to it. 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stream: I&#039;m going to stream every day from around 1 PM (GMT +1 Timezone) to an open end, starting on the 1st of February (Monday). I&#039;m not planning on getting twitch partner or gaining money thorugh donations. I won&#039;t have a donation link since that is not the reason I am doing this. I just want to share my way to the pro League with everyone who is interested in watching. I am doing this because I want to make this my Job at some point in the future.\r\nThe language spoken in the stream will be english 90% of the time obviously so everyone from everywhere will be able to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMe: Like I said I am 21 years old and from Germany. I currently have the time and the motivation to follow my dream. Besides playing league I play the piano and the guitar. If you have any further questions about me make sure to ask me while I&#039;m live, I will answer every question if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in being part of my road to the pro leauge just click on my twitch link below. No need to follow or subscribe (if it was possible) for any reason. Come and have a good time with other people of the community! And if you just want to come to hate on me by saying I suck at the game or I will never be able to make it, join the stream as well and I will, and i promise that, prove you wrong.\r\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/roadtosuccess","replies":[]}
