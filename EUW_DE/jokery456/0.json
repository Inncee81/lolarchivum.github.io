But always had the most enjoyment when playing with people i know or at least played with a couple of times.\r\nTo chase a goal as a team is simply more fun, I guess.\r\n\r\nSo couple of minutes ago, i decided to look out for some people like me.\r\nI don&#039;t wannt strict training session or stuff. i want a group of people i can improve with and try out new things from time to time.\r\n\r\nI play League for more than 5 years now. And as im still in Silver, I&#039;m sure i won&#039;t make it to the pro scene that soon.\r\nAt the moment I&#039;m playing from 4-7 days a week, mostly afternoons and evenings as I&#039;m working during day.\r\nI&#039;m above Leage age, but thats just a number.\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for?\r\n- Be friendly\r\n- Tolerant and open (0 tollerence when it comes to racism, sexism, hate speeches or anything like that)\r\n- Speak Englisch\r\n- Don&#039;t talk ALL the time. Im just not much a fan of constant nonsense talking. That&#039;s all :)\r\n- Don&#039;t flame (too much). A little salt here and there is okay. but in generell we&#039;re all here to enjoy the game. and that is hard with the amount of flaming kids in our community.\r\n- Help each other. Be open for criticism. Don&#039;t be a know-it-all - but critic helps you grow.\r\n- Real life is always more important. \r\n\r\nI just wanna have fun :) Try new tactics. improve as a player and as a team. \r\nThat would be awesome.\r\nIf you are interested, write a little something about your motivation. \r\nSee you on the Rift - \r\njokery 456","replies":[{"poster":"jokery456","date":"2018-11-08T14:32:24.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spaß und der Wille sich zu verbessern steht im Vordergrund.
