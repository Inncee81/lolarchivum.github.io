It reduces their movement speed and attack speed by 30%, their armor and magic resistance by 10, and their damage dealt by 40% for 2.5 seconds. Exhaust is an extremely powerful tool for disabling champions who mainly autoattack, as well as any champion that can deal a high amount of damage.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Exhaust","image":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/59/SummonerExhaust.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141223091643"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was the attack speed reduction and the Magic resist/Armor reduction taken off exhaust?{{summoner:3}} a tower dive by an adc like Vayne{{champion:67}} will destroy any low life tank seeking to survive under a tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Megamaexx","date":"2017-03-08T15:22:50.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weil Vayne auch dafür bekannt ist, mal eben so unter deinem Turm zu stehen...
