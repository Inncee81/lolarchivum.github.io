So you could practice some things with your friend, practice teamfights with some teamcomps and against them etc. But i would say only the Maker of the game should be able to use commands, but then for all Players of the map. And it would be a good idea if you could coordinate your bots with smart pings. That would probably help a lot (its rly anoying trying something in a botgame and all of your bots are running botlane, when you want to try how fast comp xy can kill the baron). But that would be a lot of work too, but still, i think that these are good ideas. \n\nsry for my english, i am not a native Speaker.","replies":[]}]}
