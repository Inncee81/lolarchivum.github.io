I just made my first montage EVER. If you enjoyed it a bit, then dont forget to subscribe. And yes. Im not a godlike Kalista. Im still improving a lot so be exited for better montages :P Not all of the scenes shown are form S6, some are recoded in S5 tho.","url":"https://youtu.be/cDXxq8JspGY?t=103","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDXxq8JspGY/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\ni just found this video on youtube and i would like to know how the kalista performs the action from 1:43-2:05 \nHe does not use attack move (you can only see the green movement click and not the red one, you need to minimum see it once for attack move with \"a\") and he does not click on the enemy while kiting.\nTried this in a custom game and could not kite without the red click of attack move or clicking on the enemy between jumps. Would be op though seems to be so easy when only clicking once!","replies":[{"poster":"Termii TFT","date":"2015-11-20T05:09:21.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"aa a champ -> click once to jump -> if in range of the same champ, you will auto aa that champ again -> click once to jump -> if in range ....\n\nThe hard part is:\n\n* **landing in aa range** of the same champ/minion/monster.\n* clicking exactly **once**. If you click 2 times for the jump, you cancel your auto-aa.\n* **clicking at the correct time**. The timewindow should be around 0.75 seconds, its pretty easy to hit if you play kalista often.\n\nBtw, dont try to do it exactly like the guy in the video. He obviously isnt high elo (not using his active items, struggling with huge feed and level advantage). You may be able to find a very good guide on youtube/lolking/mobafire.","replies":[{"poster":"GaiinZ","date":"2015-11-20T08:22:30.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AI Yuuki,realm=EUW,application-id=7hciEY9w,discussion-id=My8k3I4f,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-20T05:09:21.936+0000)\n>\n> aa a champ -> click once to jump -> if in range of the same champ, you will auto aa that champ again -> click once to jump -> if in range ....\n> \n> The hard part is:\n> \n> * **landing in aa range** of the same champ/minion/monster.\n> * clicking exactly **once**.
