As example, i have decided to use Taliyah, as she is meant to be a battlemage which should prefer the Hextech GLP to catch people, as she doesnt have a high range or burst (Ludens Echo) or lategame scaling (Archangels) and through her ultimate and passive is meant to catch people off-guard, which would put Hextech-GLP in a great position, if its stats would be better. Now whats the problem with the Hextech-GLP you may ask yourself?\n\nBoth Ludens and a charged Archangels Staff as single Items offer more raw AP than the Hextech GLP, either through raw stats or their passives and have really powerful effects, being Archangels huge Shield on a 120 Second cooldown (meaning its probably up in most teamfights where you may need it) and its crazy gold efficiency later in the game (ususally being finished around 20-25 minutes in) through the mana to ap conversion and the flat mana you get, allowing you to spam all your spells to waveclear or Ludens bursty Echo passive which already deals 109 damage only counting the stats Ludens gives (10% Ap Scaling) and doesnt have a set cooldown, being active on nearly every third spellcast in a teamfight.\n\nLets compare this to Hextech GLP:\nWhile the Hextech-GLP is 400 Gold cheaper, it offers less raw stats than ludens and is mostly known for its active effect, Ice Bolt. The old Hextech GLP was a niche item for some Battlemages (for Example Aurelion Sol, Anivia or sometimes Swain) and had a good impact in teamfights. The current Hextech GLP passive however stops on unit collision, making it more difficult to reach champions you want to catch. For example, you rarely hit the backline of teamfights anymore, being simply blocked by the frontline or minions. Another problem is the decreased cone of the active, which results in the projectiles being way closer together when they start, which makes them again easier to block. The damage done by the Active is minimal, being 100 +6 per Level and 20% of your AP. On level Nine, only having the Hextech GLP would result in a 164 damage Active on a 40 second cooldown.\n\nObviously, youre supposed to buy the Item for the Slow however, being 65% initial, decreasing over a second. This, compared to the 20% Slow on every spell hit without a cooldown by Rylais crystal scepter, which is 200 Gold cheaper, will make you question the overall power of the Hextech GLPs Active and if it is actually worth it, as you still have the possibility to itemize into catching enemys later by purchasing a rylais.\n\nAs you might have realized, Hextech GLP is rarely built in pro play, which proves my arguments of it getting outclassed by Archangels (primarily) and Ludens.\n\nAnother Problem this might bring up is the usage of Frozen Augment, as it was great on the old GLP but now doesnt bring in the potent slow zone it had before, leaving only Twin Shadows, Gunblade and Protobelt as catalist-Item for this rune. None of these is a great starting item except Gunblade which isnt worth it on mages and only useful on a handful of assassins which usually prefer damage runes.\n\nConcluding, as a fix i&#039;d recommend raising the items prize to 3200, bringing it in line with the other starting items and adding an amplifiying tome to the recipe, increasing its ap by 10 and reverting its active to pre-rework state to reach the catch-potential of the old Hextech GLP and embrace its actual identity.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryXenon","date":"2018-04-22T11:13:22.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"G E R M A N B O A R D S","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doo ","date":"2018-04-21T14:51:04.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D E U T S C H E S F O R U M","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroba","date":"2018-04-21T14:27:04.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D E U T S C H E S   F O R U M","replies":[]}]}
