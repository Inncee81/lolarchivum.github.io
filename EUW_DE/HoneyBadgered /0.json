Get devourer and nashors and tada you got a 130% ap ratio on every 2nd auto attack. This way you can play around the weakness of his ulti needing full rage. Bc your strongest point is when you are minignarr. Once transformed jump in and ult (hourglass if needed). Do your megagnarr until you enter your true powerform again. \r\n\r\nEarly game isnt weak at all. Since you got high attack speed early on and w is alreay huge. Im not asking to change this, but i think its a very valid way to play this lil fucker","replies":[{"poster":"Y4l0","date":"2015-09-05T11:28:23.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ist ganz lustig zu spielen","replies":[]}]}
