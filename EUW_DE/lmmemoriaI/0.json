With the newly introduced Battlegrounds we would hope to get some subs too so we can participate in the contests. However that is not the main objective, since all we wanna do is have some fun but also learn and hopefully climb some ranks as a team. We are all 13-15 so far and all speak english/german, if youre interested just add me in game: Dmonyar\r\n\r\nYou should preferably be also around 13-15 , speak english/german relatively well and bring some motivation and fun.","replies":[{"poster":"lmmemoriaI","date":"2015-04-13T15:33:12.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nThanks for replying!
