It was famous for its wool production and their happy inhabitants. This story though is about one special inhabitant of Rinkle: A small cat called Rinka. She was well known through the whole town, since she was exceptionally playful and loved to catch mice. The people loved her and it had a cheerful life until one unfortunate event.\n\nOne day, when Rinka was playing around the town, a great tragedy happened. The town was attacked by an unknown monster which looked like a giant, floating, purple eye. Due to its carefree and clumsy nature, the cat didn't notice the danger emanating from the big purple eye and tried to play catch with its tentacles. As Rinka grabbed the black moving thing, she got hit by an intense energetic shock, launching her towards the ground. The eye noticed the little cat and turned towards it to destroy with a bolt of energy, as suddenly a dark slit shaped portal opened under Rinka, letting her fall through the ground and evading the eyes attack.\n\nAs Rinka awakened on the next morning she found herself lying in the forst outside of the town. She thought, that everything was just a dream, but somehow she felt strange. Oddly her thoughts were so clear! Also her body felt heavyer... and different! \nAs she wanted to check her fur she noticed something, that scared her like she had seen a ghost. Her whole body was different and resembled a human girl, but still with fur. Also her front legs had turned into something undefinable. They were like floating bones with dark blades as claws floating around a rune where her hand should be. Additionally they weren't even connected to her body but seemed to float and move as she wanted.\nShe didn't know, what had happened, but then she started to hear a whispering in her head: \"I wanna play!\". As she tried to listen closer to the whispering, she also started to feel an urge to play. It was like a hole in her chest opening the more she was doing nothing. Her body was trembling and she only had one thought left: \"I wanna play... I MUST PLAY!\"\n________________________________________________\n\nBackground info:\nRinka was abducted by the void for an experiment: A living weapon project.\nWhile she obviously still has the instincts of a cat, her body and her mind were altered by the void, so her urge to play became an urge to kill while playing. The left part of her face is a side effect from the controlling consciousness within her head, that makes sure, she behaves as the void wants her to behave.\n\n________________________________________________\n\n**Outer Appearance:**\n\n[Lineart Sketch](http://s1.bild.me/bilder/260513/7396848scan.jpg)\n[Coloration](http://s1.bild.me/bilder/120914/305874110861015_723083504455334_1330549717773316300_o.jpg)\n\n(I designed her myself. Thank you Vanshir18 for the amazing coloration)\n\nRinkas fall through the void was no coincidence. The real cause for the portal to the void opening below the cat was one of Vel'koz rival scientists from the void. He opened a portal and abducted the small animal who survived a shock from void power. \nHe experimented on her body for several weeks and enhanced it with void magic. After her transformation she looks like a being partly human, partly cat, partly void. The reason for her not looking like a monstrousity is, that she shouldn't be noticed as a void being instantly and being liked by humans, due to her cute appearance.\nThe human part makes her a bipedal and gives her the ability to speak. Also she has breasts like a human female and her overall body shape resembles more a human.\nWhat is left from her cat part is, that her whole body is covered in light purple fur (also her breasts) and her heads shape resembles more a cat. Also she still has claws and a tail. Also her catlike playing instinct is still there.\nWhat came from the void are her magic arms, which she can disguise as normal human arms and half of her face, which turns to a black mass, whenever the voids consciousness starts to manipulate her. Her true arms are floating bones connected to a rune with five dark blades floating around it, working as former fingers/claws. The half-dark face is an evil, destructive consciousness, Vel'koz rival implanted into her to manipulate her, so she behaves like the void wants her to behave.\n\n(Lolz possible skin: Cheshire Rinka :P)\n\n________________________________________________\n\n**Role:** Jungler / Mage\n\n* Huge skillshot control utility\n* Very squishy\n\n**Stats:**\nHealth: 480 (+ 82 per Level)\nHealthReg: 6 (+0,5 per Level)\nMana: 310 (+ 46 per Level)\nManaReg: 6 (+0,5 per Level)\n\nRange: 125 (Melee)\n\nAD: 58,7 (+2,9 per Level)\nAttackspeed: 0,660 (+3,2% per Level)\nArmor: 24,5 (+3,5 per Level)\nMagic Resist.: 32,1 (+1,25 per Level)\nWalking speed: 350\n\n________________________________________________\n\n**Skills:**\n\nRinkas main ability is to open void portals and let things slip through them. This makes her a very versatile utility Champion. Although weak at first, her spells are designed to make her deadlyer, the more stuff they swallow. Her kit revolves around entertainment and games, because of her playful nature.\n\n\n**Passive:** Help from the Void\nRinkas has a split personality: a playful one and one from the void, that can communicate with the void itself and summon aid. When she or an allied champion is close to one of her portals (500 Range), she gets 0,25% bonus health regeneration and mana regeneration per portal (0,125% for allies).\n\n\n**Q: Surprise! / Tag, you're it!**\nSurprise!\nRinka thrusts her arm towards the ground, where she opens a void portal for it. A second horizontal void portal opens at the target spot, where her arm reappears and slashes around the area, dealing 40/65/80/100/120 (+60% Ability Power) magic damage to all targets within range. Afterwards she pulls her arm back, but the void portal at the target spot remains for 10 seconds.\nAdditionally, the created horizontal void portal swallows any visible trap above it and stores it for 150 seconds.\n\nTag, you're it!\nIf \"Surprise!\" is cast on a top of a horizontal void portal Rinka uses \"Tag, you're it!\" instead. Rinka jumps inside a bigger void portal below herself, reappears at the targetted portal and slashes around, dealing 50/75/100/125/150 (+80% bonus ability power) magic damage on all enemies within range and taunting the first enemy hit for 1 second.\nRange: 600\nArea of Effect: 250 around the target spot\nMana costs: 30/40/50/60/70\nCool down: 6 seconds\nCharge counters: Up to 2\n\nSummary: AoE damage and visible trap swallow at target spot. When cast on another horizontal void portal it works as a warp, deals extra damage and taunts for a short duration.\n\n\n**W: Whack a Mole**\nRinka opens 5/6/7/8/9 horizontal void portals in a circle pattern at a target spot, which spawn a voidling every second running straight from one portal to a random other one within 1 second. If an enemy is touched by a voidling, he receives 20/30/40/50/60 (+60% ability power) magic damage. When the voidling is destroyed, the portal he came from is also destroyed and the enemy is granted 14/18/22/26/30 gold. \nAdditionally, the created horizontal void portals swallow any visible traps above them and store them for 150 seconds.\nDuration: 5 seconds\nRange: 750\nVoidling HP: 30/40/50/60/70\nSpell Radius: 250/275/300/325/350\nMana costs: 60/70/80/90/100\nCool Down: 16 seconds\n\nSummary: Opens 6 voidling spawning portals, that trigger her passive and swallow traps, that are above the portals (very hard to hit, since portal location depends on her standing angle)\n\nAdditional info:\nRinka can use the Whack a Mole Portals to warp to them with her Q\n\n\n**E: Hide and Keep**\nRinka opens a vertical void portal in front of her, which absorbs one incoming skillshot hitting it. The portal remains there for 1 second. Rinka gains 40% movement speed for 3 seconds, when a skillshot is absorbed. The skillshot is then stored for 300 seconds.\nMana costs: 100\nCool down: 22 Seconds\n\nSummary: Absorbs skillshots and gives a temporary speedbuff for every absorption.\n\nAdditional info:\nHide and Keep can absorb almost any skillshot with only a few exceptions: \n-Amumu's Bandage Toss\n-Azir's Conquering Sands and Emperor's Divide.png Emperor's Divide\n-Xerath's Rite of the Arcane.png Rite of the Arcane\n-Orianna's Command: Attack\n-Zed's Living Shadow\n\n**R: Look what I found!!**\nRinka opens 6/8/10 portals in two parallel rows, randomly releasing all stored skillshots and traps dealing their original damage +10/20/30 flat magic damage per 100 AP of Rinka. All skillshots and traps now damage the enemy instead of Rinka and her allies.\nRange: 300 (Start position); 500/600/700 length; 500 width (Vector aimed)\nDuration: 4/6/8 seconds\nMana costs: 100/100/100\nCool down: 150/130/110 seconds\n\nSummary: Nothing more to summarize\n\n\n_______________________________________\n\n**Counterplay:**\n\nAlthough she seems very strong, especially against champions, that utilize skillshots, there are several different tactics, how to deal with her and shut her down:\n\n**1st:**\nSince she relies on portals she made before to do a good amount of damage with her Q (which is her main damage source), her moves can be forseen and this can be utilized very good for luring her out or counter ganking.\nHer portals can be used to lure her out, by walking near a portal, making her think, she can jump there for burst damage, then turning around, to evade her splash damage and counter attacking when her Q is on cool down.\nAlso Champions that can turn invisible (Evelynn, Rengar, Khazix, etc.) will not be revealed from her portals.\n\n**2nd:**\nWhile her W can do a lot of damage and gives her a high Life/Mana Reg Bonus, this skill can be abused for getting a lot of extra gold, since the voidlings have only 1 life.\nAt skill lvl 1 for example destroying all voidlings grants 70 gold. At skill lvl 5 it even grants 150 gold.\n\n**3rd:**\nHer ulti can be weakened, by shooting weak skillshots inside her Hide and Keep (E), since her ulti can only shoot back up to 12-24 skillshots, for example:\n-Ashes Volley (W) since only one Arrow will be collected\n-Ezreals Essence Flux (W) since it has has a small range\n-Lissandras Glacial Path (E) since it is very slow\n-Miss Fortunes Bullet Time (R), since only one bullet will be collected\n-Rumbles Electric Harpoon (E) since one harpoon is very weak\nApart from that her \"Hide and Keep\" (E) costs a lot of mana and has to be used every 22 seconds to get the maximum potential. This is 1200-2400 mana.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n**Voice:**\nRinka has a very bright, childish voice, except when her evil/mad personality makes her laugh from its evil thoughts. Then her voice turns a bit darker and more rough. \nWhile she walks around, her basic phrases consist of different meows and sometimes the following phrases:\n\"We've got so much to play with, here.\"\n\"This place is sooooooooo fun!\"\n\"Oh, look! A fluffy, moving ball !\" (Reference to Poros)\n\n\n**Jokes:**\n\"Why don't you wanna play with me? I'm not a cheetah!\"\n\"Maybe I'll take a nap...just kitten\" *sweet laugh* (just kitten as an homophone to just kiddin')\n\n\n**Taunts:**\n\"You wanna play with me? I'll play with you.\" *evil laugh*\n\nTo Ahri: \"I'd become sick of having so many tails I could chase.\"\n\nTo Amumu: \"Don't be so sad, bandage man. I'll play with you!\" *starting mad laugh*\n\nTo Lulu: \"Hey you! Help me catch that silly butterfly over your head.\"\n\nTo Maokai: \"Wow, what a nice scratching posts here!\"\n\nTo Nami: \"Summoners are so nice, giving food to me.\"\n\nTo Nidalee: \"*HIISSSSS!!!* This is MY playground!\"\n\nTo Orianna: \"Whoooaaaa!! Give me that ball! I wanna play!\"\n\nTo Twitch: \"A rat!! More food!!!\" *evil laugh*\n\nTo Vel'koz: \"Hey! I know you! Let's play again!!\"\n\n\n**Dance:**\nHer dance is typical for her childish, naive and playful character. She starts to chase her tail, trying to jump on it.\n\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSoooo... that's it.\nFeel free to make suggestions and leave comments on my idea!\nAlso I would be glad if a gifted colouring artist could improve the coloured version of my sketch. I can send u the uncoloured lineart.
