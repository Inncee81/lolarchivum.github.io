As the elo gap became wider and wider and my third smurf account is unable to play with them i started looking for more competeive and serious teams. I played in four teams already in two of them as support and two of them as midlaner.\r\nMy goals are to improve my own gameplay and be succesful in tournaments and just see how high i can get.\r\nI am very team oriented so even though i am clearly a Ahri main i will be willing to play every champion for the team.\r\nCurrently i am able to play Ahri, Ori, Ryze, Lux on a high level but as I said just tell me which champ you need for your team and i will practice it.\r\n\r\nI am 22 years old and speak german and english fluently. Of course i have a mic and ts.\r\n\r\nI would love to be your teams new midlaner =)\r\n\r\npls add me ingame\r\n\r\nregards TheCaptainZ","replies":[]}
