I dont know if it's just be but I feel like its kinda off. I recently played Malphite against a full AD team. I Built: {{item:3025}} , {{item:3047}} , {{item:3075}} , {{item:3143}} , {{item:3027}} , {{item:3001}} .With my w active I had around 500 armor and only a little below 4k life. Can you Imagine my surprise when I met the enemy Yi in Jungle who just killed me without getting any dmg? His build was: {{item:3006}} , {{item:3142}} , {{item:3031}} , {{item:3153}} , {{item:3072}} {{item:3101}} . So yes he wasn't even done with the build. Now I ask: Why didnt he get any dmg from Thornmail AND healed the dmg of my skills? 30% lifesteal, yes but he heals for 30% of the life he actually deals right? So after my 500 armor applied. Thornmail should retur 30% of the dmg before armor is applied. So it should be a lot more and Yi could only have around 20 MR max with this build. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion is: Building armor is totally useless. With Botrk building Life is useless too. So what to do? \r\nWhen I see the assassins in this game building Black Cleaver, Last Whisper and Youmus Ghostblade its even more an off balance game. I mean I put my whole inventory full of armor and when I calculate a little its as  if I built maybe 60 armor because of all this % reduction. \r\n\r\nI know League of Legend discovered a problem with strong tanks in Season 2 but as it stands now I can only see Tanks getting just useless. The Scenario I described is a good one for tanks because I only needed to build armor. When I need to build MR too and the ADs and APs build some of their Penetration Items it is as if all my Items I built are useless. And whats left is some Life, that just melts with thier atacks.","replies":[{"poster":"MeMyselfandBaal","date":"2015-03-21T14:09:18.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, a Yi will kill a Tank One on One... but it will take forever. And in LoL you usually dont have much time... And as a Tank you never want to fight one on ones... you come through the CC and you need Damage Dealers to use that CC for Auto Attacks.\n\n\nUsually their Carry has to get through you to get to your Carrys, and they (especially with a melee Yi) can just AutoAttack him, while you hard CC him. The longer you survive, the longe your ADC can attack freely without being focused. So yeah, surviving vor 5 Seconds does matter... If your Ashe didnt do AutoAttack the Yi, then it's not the fault of the system.\n\nOh, und wer Rechtschreibfehler findet... ich habe im Deutschen Forum nur die Deutsche Rechtschreibkontrolle installiert...","replies":[]}]}
