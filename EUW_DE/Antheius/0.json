We are looking for experienced players on toplane, jungle and botlane, either support or adc. We also need a strong shotcaller, who has deep game knowledge and is able to call for objectives well and generally help the team close out games. We are both around D5 elo, I myself am Plat 3, my friend is Diamond 5 in soloQ currently, so we would prefer you to be around that soloQ elo aswell. Once we found some guys to play with and built some team synergy, we would like to compete in some tournaments aswell, and practice somewhat regularely during the week, most likely in the afternoon for a few hours. If you are interested or have questions, feel free to add either of us. in game names:\r\nVeS Antheius (me)\r\nSaint Fate (my friend)\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"HÃ® Im Roasted","date":"2015-12-09T23:45:37.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i just found ur post\nI am a main ADC or MID but mostly ADC atm\nIm plat 5 for myself but alot of people say im playing better \nim 16 years old\ni have teamspeak skype usw..\nIm nicely and yeah just feel free to add me","replies":[]}]}
