I thought: &quot;Hey! That&#039;s why we have custom mode with bots.&quot; But it took way too long to get my items, test my abilities etc. A sandbox mode would have helped alot, where I can artificially increase level and gold, to get to the main combos or key items right off the bat.\r\nEven now, as an experienced player, I would love to see such a possibility.\r\nCurrently I am trying to improve as a fiora player and there is so much I can do. Or rather I could, if it wouldn&#039;t be so tiresome. With a sandbox mode I could start to train my autoattack-reset-combo without having to start farming for gold and experience first. Additionally having a &quot;sandbag&quot; with infinite HP and a button to reset all cd, would make training champs much more relaxing.\r\nIt shouldn&#039;t be that hard to do, as many other MOBA&#039;s such as DOTA or Heroes of the Storm already offer such a service  and it doesn&#039;t need to be too complex.\r\nA simple lane with one camp and some buttons would be more than enough.\r\nI am sure many players, unranked to challanger would appreciate it.\r\nThis comment was inspired by stonewall008.
