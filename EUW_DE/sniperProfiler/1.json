It tries to block as little space as possible and still holds the various types of information relatively tight together. \r\n\r\nMy problem with the current overlays in the EU-LCS, NA-LCS and the LCK is the icon box of dead champions. When a champion dies, the icon gets greyed out, the Death Timer appears over the Icon and the Life- and Manabars are empty. But unline an empty mana bar of a living champion the background is not black but transparrent. This causes to &quot;break&quot; the blocks that your eyes are fixed on not changing. So whenever the camera moves now and the brightness of the background (which the manabar would normally cover) changes you get distraced. \r\nIt isnt that impactfull, but subconciously I remember, that this part normally stays the same. Now the brightness changes in a spot where i dont expect it and i get distracted. And the best part is, that i dont instantly see whats wrong when the bar hovers over the fog of war, because thats also dark. Its just a little detail but it can frustrate me so much, because i get annoyed by it every time someone dies.\r\n\r\nHave you made similar expiriences? Can a Rioter maybe relay this to someone who made the HUD, so we can have a discussion, why they changed it and what the reason is, they made the bars for dead champs transparent?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this\r\nYours sincerly casio888","replies":[]}
