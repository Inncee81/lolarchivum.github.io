Their top pick was Singed; after 10 minutes I was 0/4, after 20 minutes the game was over. I wasn&#039;t feeding, I died under the turret. Singed had 200+ farm after 20 minutes, he snowballed all lanes, even our botlane that had been winning against them (they had a lucian adc that had 27 farm after 20 minutes).\r\n\r\nSinged mentioned in all chat that he would gladly boost me to gold (giving a price). And all the while I was flamed for being such a bad player. Here&#039;s a link http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/euw/anrisas showing the history of games played by Singed who was boosting his entire team. (And here a link of his team member lucian, that has a very interesting variation in skill: how can he have 27 and in the previous 300+ farm? http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/euw/snNob4Style). Another members (lee sin) of their team had been writing in all chat as well, they probably knew each other.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how do I report this to RIOT in a way they will definitely KNOW? I mean, after the game the ezrael who had been winning against that boosted lucian was mad at me, for &quot;losing the game&quot;, getting ME reported. So unless I can write a ticket that will be read it seems people like that will get away with it. I submitted a request on the official website https://support.riotgames.com, detailing the game, but I don&#039;t think that is what &quot;request&quot; about gameplay should be about.\r\n\r\nWhere do I go/ask?\r\n\r\ngreetings,\r\nNIHILIR","replies":[{"poster":"Doo ","date":"2016-11-05T14:32:59.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first, you're in the german forum.
