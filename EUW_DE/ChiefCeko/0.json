So at a random stage in the game i Q, then E to reset his Q cd but it does not happen and i have to wait the full Q or for another E cd.\n\nHard to reconstruct the Bug. but it happens almost every game at least once or twice, though isolated not persistent. If the bug occurs in an all in, i might lose a fight i would have won without the bug, which may very well decide a game.{{champion:13}} {{item:3070}} \n\nvimeo.com/243218817\n\nWatch the Video. (EUW Preseason Plat Footage) As i use my E to kill a minion and spread Flux i try to Q and it seems like the animation gets cancelled or something. Mana is being used as seen in the -40 blue indicator, Q is on CD and no Overload animation is visible nor has any Dmg been done.\n\nRiot pls Fix that!\n\nGreetings, \n\nChiefCeko","replies":[{"poster":"MrNath","date":"2017-11-22T11:38:13.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow i thought the lack of traction here meant this was in my head. i sent a bug report in game too but have heard nothing.\n\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/iL4oEwJE-ryze-e-not-resetting-q","replies":[]}]}
