One of these are AFK Players in SoloQ. I wanted some feedback by u guys cus i got an idea how we can deal with AFK&#039;s.\r\n\r\nFirst of all what is the most annoying when having an AFK??? U loose leauge points or maybe loose ur promotion or sth. like that.\r\n\r\nWe cant solve the problem of having no fun when playing with AFK&#039;s but what we could do is atleast not let the game cus of an AFK let u loose points!\r\n\r\nU might ask how do u want to prevent this from happening? Well its pretty simple just let the game count as a &#039;&#039;loss prevented&#039;&#039; game. What Riot should do is letting games count as loss prevented, where people have somebody to go AFK since lvl 1 who does not come back till the end of the game.\r\nI feel like this might be a good idea for the next patch since it has no Cons. (Thats why i want feedback so we can find some Cons or Pros).","replies":[{"poster":"Tekilla809","date":"2015-03-31T06:56:12.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what youve got from loss preventet ?\nyou have to play that unbalanced game anyway then.\nIts not about loosing points.\nThis happens on each side of the team.\nSomeday you have an afk someday the others.\nSo no points lost.\nSo to count this as loss preventet would just help those,\nwho cant handle a situation that is difficult.\n\nTo handle the afk is the way to deal with an afk.\n\n\nIn my opinion the only good solution would be to\nreplace the afk with a new player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeMyselfandBaal","date":"2015-03-29T14:55:58.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is the first time i hear this... today... \nBut honestly: how many Games where someone is AFK all Game long do you have? 1 in 50? An yes, I just quickly checked your Ranked History and that a teammember didnt at least buy a tinket happened exactly once in the last 2 months... Yes, it's annoying, but it is also extremly rare... too rare to write an exception for it...\nOh and what is the best part about AFKs? You gain LP and may be even complete you Promos in a 5vs4 Game... but those incidents get frogotten instantly...","replies":[{"poster":"Zokkar","date":"2015-03-29T15:13:58.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rare but there.
