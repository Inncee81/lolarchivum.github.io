We aren&#039;t preferring women based on skill, attitude or any kind of prejudice. There are certain Women LoL Tournaments (f.i. Girl Gamer eSports Festival Cup) in which the team *could not compete with male members*. We will consider a mixed team *if we don&#039;t find enough suitable female players*. But you will understand that we know enough male/non-female players personally who&#039;d fit perfectly (mentality-, skill- and personality-wise) and are therefore not looking for any. Thank you very much for your understanding.)\n\n>**Your qualities**\nYour Elo is rather unimportant, but you should at least have hit Platinum (unboosted and not as an OTP) and shouldn&#039;t aim for less than mid Dia in S8.\nWhat matters to us is your mentality.\nWe are looking for exceptional players that are led by a drive to exceed their own expectation and strive for perfection. Therefore you should be very competitive and a huge tryhard. *Giving up is not an option.*\nGood Teamplay is dependent on good mood. That is why you should be able to keep a cool head and motivation up as well.\n---\n**No-Go&#039;s**\nWhat is unwanted and will not be tolerated is boosting, gossip, drama, attention seeking, being fake, flaking out, toxic behaviour and such. \nTeammates should be able to rely on each other. This cannot be dirtied by such unwanted features. A responsible, honest, good-natured interaction is needed not only ingame, but overall.\n---\n**Time**\nYou should not only bring plenty of time in the evenings (ger UTC+01:00), but be able to commit to a schedule. Being dependable and keeping appointments is vital.\n---\n**Coaching**\nCoaching will be arranged, when our roster is definite. It will primarily cover team improvement and strategy.\nThe coaches job is to harshly criticize and correct us and show us how to advance. Praising and applauding would not bring us far, so you need to be able to appreciate criticism.\nIt is your duty to learn and improve individually, but in mutual understanding teammates will look out for each other. If required, personal coaching will be provided.\n\nIf you are interested to join, please, add marytheflo and introduce yourself!\nWe are really excited to meet you. :)\nPeace,\nMary","replies":[]}
