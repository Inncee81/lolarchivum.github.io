La idea es conservar su identidad es complicada, estaba este modelo en reddit (removido, pero lo guardé porque me gustó bastante el camino que plantea).\n___\nAs everybody knows, Poppy's rework is incoming, but actually we don't know yet how to make that rework. The idea to conserve Poppy's identity intact and improve her play style (and the ability required to reach success) is something complicated, but the way we manage at least is something like this:\n- Change her passive? not exactly: add a second passive skill, a little complicated to use or, better said, a little complicated to decide how. Complete will conserve her actual passive and added the next description:\nPassive 1: Valiant Figther: All physical and Magic Damage dealt to Poppy that exceeds 10% of her current Health is reduced by 50%. This does not reduce damage from structures.\nPassive 2: Ambassador's will: Every 6 spells, the next basic ability will have a bonus effect.\n\n- Poppy's Q concept is ok, the only addition would be the bonus for the passive effect.\nDevastating Blow: Poppy crushes her opponent, dealing attack damage plus a flat amount and 8% of her target's max Health as bonus damage. The bonus damage cannot exceed a threshold based on rank.\nAmbassador's Will effect: The damage will be true damage, instead of magic damage.\n\nI'll stop here a second to explain a little thing. This is really a buff, but not an insane buff. Remember, with these parameters, Vayne's third basic attack is still stronger, for example, is not a totally unbalanced idea. Anyway, with this change the damage would be balanced in order to don't make an abussive skill.\n\n- Poppy's W is very good right now, the \"common\" effect don't needs changes at all. But, for the new passive model, an improve would be like this:\nParagon of Demacia: Passive: Upon receiving damage from or dealing damage with a basic attack, Poppy's Armor and damage are increased for 5 seconds. This effect can stack 10 times. Active: Poppy gains max stacks of Paragon of Demacia and her Movement Speed is increased for 5 seconds.\nAmbassador's will effect: When Poppy's active this ability, a anti-spell shield will protect her for 1.5 seconds.\n\nI'll stop again. Is a very useful effect, but remember, in order to activate it you need to calculate correctly your passive and sacrificate other ability improvement.\n\n- For Poppy's E is important make some changes. Poppy's E is an autodirected ability, it will be better as a skillshot, with exactly the same effect as now. For a improvement to Poppy's assassin role, a reset for kill or assist would be a good idea too.\nHeroic Charge: Poppy charges at a location and carries the first enemy champion on her way them further. The initial impact deals a small amount of damage, and if they collide with terrain, her target will take a high amount of damage and be stunned. On a champion kill or assist, Heroic Charge's cooldown resets.\nAmbassador's will effect: If Poppy charges more than one enemy (minions and monsters can be affected) on her way, every target will collide with the next on her trayectory and all the enemies impacted will be stunned.\n\nThis effect would be really great and fun. With basic E, Poppy only charge the first enemy on her way, and as a skillshot, she can use this ability for mobility without a target. But, with the passive effect, she could do interesting plays using her opponents like a pain train, crushing them with themselves. An little explanation, if Poppy is on a point and charges to a direction with Ryze, Alistar and a single minion in her way (lined in that order), Poppy first charges over Ryze, when Ryze collide with Alistar, Ryze will be stuned, when Alistar collide with the minion, Alistar will be stuned too and if a wall is behind the minion, the minion will be stuned as well.\n\n- Poppy's ultimate ir really a very characteristic skill, only need a little change: Be used on largest monsters (Baron or Dragon). If Poppy can ult one of these monsters, can steal them most efficiently.\nDiplomatic Immunity: Poppy focuses intently on a single enemy champion or largest monster, dealing increased damage to them. Poppy is immune to any damage and abilities from enemies other than her target.\nAmbassador's will not affect this ability, only basic spells.\n___\n\nTraduzco más o menos: Poner otra pasiva que cada 6 habilidades dé una bonificación a la siguiente habilidad que Poppy use.\n\nLa Q pegaría daño verdadero\nLa W activaría un escudo anti-hechizos\nLa E que sería skillshot y tendría reset arrollaría todo lo que se cruce\nLa R no se vería afectada por la nueva pasiva, pero está la idea de que se pueda aplicar en monstruos grandes.","replies":[{"poster":"ZaerQras","date":"2015-03-28T02:08:58.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TiramisuDelMal,realm=LAS,application-id=v7qsfXsE,discussion-id=N5PEhwcE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-27T01:37:33.622+0000)\n>\n> Tengo entendido que están con pocas ideas sobre cómo hacerle el nuevo kit de habilidades.
