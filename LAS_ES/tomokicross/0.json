Hace mucho tiempo que no se lanza un campe&oacute;n que sea destinado para esta funci&oacute;n espec&iacute;ficamente. \r\nSe ha especulado que prontamente tendriamos una nueva incorporaci&oacute;n a las filas de los campeones que gustan de ayudara los dem&aacute;s.\r\n\r\nPor lo dicho en los foros de NA ser&iacute;a un campe&oacute;n que su potencial se ver&iacute;a reflejado junto a un compa&ntilde;ero en el carril inferior (no como {{champion:427}} que finalmente fue enfocado en el rol de jungla). Es por esto que se me hace interesante saber m&aacute;s al respecto.\r\n\r\nAgradecer&iacute;a cualquier contribuci&oacute;n que se pudiera hacer.\r\n\r\nDe antemano, gracias.\r\n\r\nHasta el momento lo que se ha dicho es:\r\n\r\nEn la discusi&oacute;n, @Meddler, next champ when?\r\n\r\n&gt; There&#039;ll be a significantly bigger gap between Camille and the next new champ than normal. Another VGU (Galio) will indeed be in the middle there, that doesn&#039;t mean Galio&#039;s going to follow immediately on from Warwick though (Galio&#039;s soonish, but not really soon).  \r\n\r\nEn la discusi&oacute;n, @Riot, Can we get more Support champs in 2017?\r\n\r\n&gt; We intend to release a champion this year who should work well in a traditional support playstyle (focus on helping allies/hindering enemies rather than damage, works well in a duo lane).\r\n\r\n&gt; My phrasing there&#039;s to distinguish between the support position and what many players refer to as supports (the buff/heal giving types we refer to internally as enchanters). I certainly think the champ in question will get play primarily in in duo lanes and be most effective with an ally to lane with.\r\n\r\nEn la discusi&oacute;n, Are we getting 6 new champions this year?\r\n\r\n&gt; Can&#039;t make any promises about total number of champions this year yet. For whatever it&#039;s worth the gap between the new champion after Galio and the new one after that should be a bit shorter than usual though at least.\r\n\r\nQuick Gameplay Thoughts: March 10\r\n\r\n&gt; The next new champ will be coming out before the next VGU. Once they&#039;re out we&#039;ll also share some details for anyone curious as to why the longer than usual gap between new champ releases and whether the circumstances that caused it are likely to crop up again or not.\r\n\r\n&gt; Personal opinion (haven&#039;t talked with the Live Gameplay team about those two specifically recently) is that Graves is too universally good a pick and probably too strong. Less sure on Rumble, though seems very worth watching.\r\n\r\n&gt; Agree timing on next new champ&#039;s still vague. I don&#039;t want to undercut the release process the team working on that character have planned though, so that&#039;s about all I can offer as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Charlôtte","date":"2017-03-11T11:18:16.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Efectivamente, el campeón que viene es soporte, me lo \"confirmaron\" (spoilearon)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Runth","date":"2017-03-11T10:54:03.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:432}}  si veo como ese. buacala","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Crucifix ","date":"2017-03-11T07:38:30.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"support\"\n\nhttps://img.memesuper.com/6bc818f0fc351dbd3dc200dbf8a113f4_ay-no-guacala-memes-ay-no-guacala_253-174.jpeg","replies":[]}]}
