Playing Vayne against higher range gap-closers such as Alistar, Akali, Irelia, or Zac, you can maintain a 600 range leash and cast Condemn, constantly canceling your Condemn command as soon as you walk forward and re-issuing the command once you return to your 600 range leash. Condemn will only cast once its target has entered a 550 range bubble around Vayne. This means that it will never cast, as long as you constantly issue the command at a higher range. However, once your enemy does enter this range, Condemn will immediately cast and knock them back. In this situation, you would interrupt these gap-closers in the middle of their dash. In the case that they do nothing, you will look like you are staggering back and forth, but cast nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Win","date":"2016-06-12T23:42:46.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pro Addict","date":"2016-06-12T20:08:06.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Su Kha devi spammare Q finché il target non entra in range.
