The other ones doesn't have to build mr in every match. Blitz can go tank with Spirit Visage or Banshee, Swain works really good with Spirit Visage (cause of 20% bonus healing), Ryze can go for a Banshee or for an Abyssal Scepter (for more AP). I think mr items are great.","replies":[{"poster":"73668109_DEL","date":"2015-12-13T08:29:30.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, se tu have to dire qualcosa here, sei prayed to dirlo in italian.
