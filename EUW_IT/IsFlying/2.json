I really would like to main him,but i want to be sure that he&#039;s a good champ to main.","replies":[{"poster":"ClearÏ‰ay","date":"2019-02-05T21:20:01.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play what you like and not what is good. At the moment there are a lot of better midlaners, Ekko is not top tier if you are asking this. But it means nothing, if you like him and play him good just enjoy. I reached diamond with shaco in s7 when he was so bad as an assassint that he was played as  a bruiser/tank.\nThis means that you can play what you want when you want. Don't look at the meta or at the competitive part of lol, it's not the same thing as the soloq","replies":[]}]}
