Fascinated, Vel'Koz deconstructs one of the ruins and analyzes them, discovering that place once held powerful magics. He ventures within the Clock Tower to discover numerous, highly advanced technology within, the likes of which even he himself has never seen. Analyzing the tower, he infers that the Urtistanians were able to manipulate time, a power that only Zilean, an Urtistanian, could use, and that the owner has only recently left. Now obsessed with this knowledge, he sets out to find its owner. Not before destroying his companions.\"\n\nIn pratica Vel'Koz sta cacciando ZIlean per il suo potere di manipolare il tempo","replies":[{"poster":"MyXanadu","date":"2016-12-30T16:45:31.873+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tutte balle!
