And also, come and pick us as ignorant ... But why do not you go break somewhere else? These comments are not accepted by any community, which may be the Italian, French, Russian, Spanish or any other community, a community would not like to be taken as ignorant only because some people do not know English, you you have to come to understand that rightly I do not all know English, so you do not have to go stupid in writing, writing things like \"wow, I'm surprised that there are not only people who know how to write / say how they are called in English\". Because if I ask you, \"tell me how do you call it\" in Italian, obviously you do not know it, and I could call you ignorant, so think twice before giving ignorance to someone.
