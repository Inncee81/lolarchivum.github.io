However, the matter is more difficult in the formal interpretation of natural language; formally the sentence is logically ambiguous and alternatively could be interpreted as meaning, for example:[2]\n> \n> (as an imperative) Measure the speed of flies like you would measure that of an arrow - i.e. (You should) time flies as you would time an arrow.\n> (imperative) Measure the speed of flies in the way an arrow would - i.e. (You should) time flies in the same manner that an arrow would time them.\n> (imperative) Measure the speed of flies with qualities resembling those of arrows - i.e. (You should) time those flies that are like an arrow.\n> (declarative) Time moves in a way an arrow would.\n> (declarative, i.e. neutrally stating a proposition) Certain flying insects, called \"time flies,\" enjoy an arrow.\n> In addition, the sentence contains semantic ambiguity. For instance, the noun phrase \"Time flies\" could refer to all time flies or particular time flies, and \"an arrow\" to all arrows, a particular arrow, or different arrows for different flies; compare \"Fruit flies like a banana\", \"Fruit flies ate a banana\", \"Fruit flies live on a banana\". Likewise, the noun \"Time\" could refer to the magazine.","replies":[{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2016-10-07T14:39:06.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shin Tera,realm=EUW,application-id=PqgdRhzF,discussion-id=HyrnQIba,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-07T14:24:42.354+0000)\n>\n> \n\nWow!\n\nGrazie <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kim114","date":"2016-10-07T14:22:14.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"converti per i semplici di mente pls","replies":[]}]}
