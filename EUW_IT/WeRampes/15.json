See Curse&rsquo;s announcement for more info: http://riot.com/1GO19xu&quot;\r\nThe tweet links to this statement from Curse CEO  Hubert Thieblot regarding their voice communication program Curse Voice.\r\n&quot;I&#039;m pleased to announce that Riot Games has decided to invest in Curse.\r\n\r\nRiot really believes in what we&#039;re doing and where we&#039;re going. This investment boosts our efforts to continue creating what I believe to be the best communication tool in gaming.\r\n\r\nIn the last year, we&#039;ve seen the size of Curse Voice grow from nothing to over 1 million active players. We&#039;ve added support for most of the top 200 games in the world and are deeply integrated with some of the most popular games our players play.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, exciting and positive news for us. We&#039;ve known Riot for a long time, and know that Riot, like us, cares very deeply about the core gamer. I&#039;m excited and confident that this will be good for Curse and for the millions of players we serve via Curse Voice.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nHubert Thieblot\r\nCEO, Curse Inc.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Whommy","date":"2015-07-02T14:15:02.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"sono 10 mesi che si pu√≤ usare","replies":[]}]}
