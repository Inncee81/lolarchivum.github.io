I get reported if I help people with their build because they think im being mean. And I get reported wihtout even flaming. when i get reported i also get bans. right now i got a ban that says i have 75 chat restricts and need to win 35 draft modes before i can play ranked again. and as a player who doesnt got alot of time to play league and really enjoys ranked this bothers me alot. te system is fine but people abuses it to get other people banned. And when i have very little time to play league it results in winning all the 35 games will take 2 months maybe less maybe more. So please do something about the problem and unban me","replies":[{"poster":"Giovarco","date":"2015-03-15T12:47:29.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random reports mean nothing because reports are inspected by reds.
