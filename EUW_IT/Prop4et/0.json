Where you can almost know who wins from the pick and bans fase, where everything is almost decided by the comp that protects better the adc with shields and damage reduction while the team who has the strongest (i mean as a champ, not as a player) adc wins? I know i&#039;m generalising a bit too much cause if a team plays with better macro they can outscale this kind of composition but having this immortals adcs who doesn&#039;t care of ositioning as long as their team is with them is kinda frustrating for example sometghing that Deficio often says is that a rumble who doesn&#039;t snowball is not a threat thank&#039;s to redemption, solari and ardent censer as well, while before all this shields and stuff came in teamfighting against a rumble was always risky.\r\nImho the biggest error was not introducing the ardent censer nerf before worlds started, ofc it&#039;s not an item that can bring victory, but it surely helps a lot.\r\nPut a big frontline ahead of your adc and just keep shielding and healing himg.
