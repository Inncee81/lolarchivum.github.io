Removing ranged crit's not the solution we're trying out however, we feel that does add some important value to the ADC role. What we're looking into instead for fighters are items that:\n> \n>         Are a combination of offensive/defensive effects and therefore generally of noticeably lower appeal to ADCs who want to go full offense (e.g. the revised Black Cleaver which has a significant part of its budget spent on health, something fighters are fine with, but ADCs often aren't).\n>         Offer additional rewards when combined with other defensive/partially defensive items (Atma's Impaler back in the day was an example of this sort of effect. It did have some other issues and so we felt we had to remove it, we believe there may be some variants on the concept that work better however).\n>         Help melee champions engage in a fight, or stick to targets better once in a fight, in ways that aren't as consistently useful or accessible on ranged champions (Randuin's and Phage are good examples of this category) .\n> \n>     We're currently working on some items using the above approaches, which are intended in part to be good fits on heavy, immobile fighters like Garen, Darius, Udyr etc. More details to follow sometime pretty soon (patch 5.16 or 5.17 at a guess, so potentially hitting PBE 1-3 weeks from now, depending on how the rest of the work goes).\"\n> \n> When asked if Essence Reaver will be getting any changes here, he noted:\n> \n>     \"Essence Reaver we'll look at when we work on ADC itemization.\"\n> \n> [UPDATE] When asked about his comments of Udyr and Garen being heavy immobile fighters, Meddler elaborated:\n> \n>     \"Yeah, that's the sort of distinction we've got in mind here, with heavy fighters being those without dashes/jumps/blinks. Fighters that have to fight, or at least walk past, the enemy front line, rather than diving onto their preferred targets. \n> \n>     Also very much a soft distinction, rather than a black/white mobile/immobile thing, particularly in cases where a champion's strongest back line access is a longer CD ult (e.g. Shyvana).\"\n> \n> He continued:\n> \n>     \"Lack of burst mobility's what we're looking at here, as opposed to sustained or strategic mobility.\"\n> \n> \n> He also added:\n> \n>     \"We've got a lot of stuff being worked on for 5.16 or possibly 5.17. As a result 5.15 will be a somewhat smaller patch than usual.\" [/spoiler]","replies":[{"poster":"Necktie","date":"2015-08-05T14:21:38.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beh adesso decisamente un lutto, l'ho giocato ieri sul PBE ed il nerf alla velocità della E è una cavolata colossale secondo me, farà anche più danno ma non hai il tempo di farlo, il silence della Q dura di meno ed il rallentamento del 20% non permette di fare danno agli avversari che fuggono via in niente, il flash diventa assolutamente obbligatorio così come la mannaia. Per il resto la meccanica del villain è molto simpatica, è cpme se fosse una quest, gli altri cambiamenti ci possono anche stare, ma la tenacity rimossa alla W, il silence ridotto a 1,5 secondi e soprattutto il 20% di velocità in meno alla E lo rendono davvero poco pericoloso per chi ha un minimo di mobility.\nRiporto il testo dei cambiamenti:\n\n>  Hi everyone,\n> \n> Since Garen's headed to PBE now, I wanted to get a thread up to centralize feedback, as well as a place to put his up-to-date changelist.
