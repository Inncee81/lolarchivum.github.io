I was silver 3 in the preseason and i after promotionals i ended in bronze 2 with 8 wins. i was close to go bronze 1 but then things got downhill.... in most games i always have somebody that feeds or goes afk. no matter if i roam we end up losing most times. i dont rage except one game.  also i cant play with my friends because we dont meet a lot of times to go ranked.And now im bronze 4. no matter how friendly i am no matter what i do i just cant win. i wanted to go back to silver but thats just impossible {{item:3070}} give me some advice if possible please","replies":[{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2016-02-03T23:56:47.462+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the italian board dude, pls use italian or post on http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/\n:)\n\nMy advices are:\n\n- Don't play when you are tilted. After two loses, stop ranked for today. Play only when your mind is fresh.\n\n- Every time you die ask yourself what was your mistake. Focus on not going out of position, this helped me climb  lot.\n\n- Don't play in ranked champions that are just released (like Jhin, you know which game i'm talking about) and play only the campions you feel confident on. Just play your best.\n\nGood luck! Remember that elo hell is only on your mind. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ubercodlegend200","date":"2016-02-04T05:36:26.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}}  spam this guy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr LouD","date":"2016-02-04T09:25:00.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to get out of Bronze?
