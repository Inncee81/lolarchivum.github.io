As crowd controls impact a unit's combat ability, they are essentially more specialized forms of debuffs - however, this ability to directly hinder a unit's ability to fight means that crowd controls are often given significantly more importance in regular gameplay than normal debuffs, resulting in their special classification.\n\nThere are many different forms of crowd control in League of Legends, each of which is unique in the way it affects its target and the ways it can - if at all - be resisted, mitigated or removed. Some crowd controls can be exclusive or near-exclusive to certain champions or items, and different champions can apply the same crowd control in multiple different ways. A few specific mechanics (such as Yasuo Last Breath) even require a catalyst crowd control to function.","replies":[{"poster":"xAle2x","date":"2016-09-14T11:49:22.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"9/10\n\nMeglio di così c'è solo LetMeGoogleThatForYou","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loki Toki ","date":"2016-09-13T20:46:55.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"sono quelle skills che dovrebbero caratterizare i ruoli del jungler e del support","replies":[{"poster":"l  Ferox  l","date":"2016-09-14T07:49:21.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Invece i Mid/Top/Adc non hanno e/o non devono avere cc secondo il tuo ragionamento :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mytlix","date":"2016-09-13T20:54:49.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trist0Mietitore,realm=EUW,application-id=98NGV4Al,discussion-id=xX3AiExm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-13T20:46:55.586+0000)\n>\n> sono quelle skills che dovrebbero caratterizare i ruoli del jungler e del support\n\nNo..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l  Ferox  l","date":"2016-09-13T20:08:43.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crowd control ... tutte quelle abilità che stordiscono, rallentano, silenziano etc","replies":[{"poster":"Kim114","date":"2016-09-13T20:36:43.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Effetti di controllo negativi, debuff","replies":[]}]}]}
