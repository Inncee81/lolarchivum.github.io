It seems to work normally for me now, but I'm gonna test it out in a few more games to be certain.\n\nHere's what I did so far:\nUpdate all Drivers\nUpdate BIOS to the newest version\nUpdate EC to the newest version\nRun Hextech Repair Tool to completely reinstall the game\n\nNone of this helped, until I found that during the freezes, my CPU load was exceptionally high. The culprit was a program called Nahimic. I think its some kind of audio driver. As the game went on, it used up more and more CPU load, until everything became unplayable. The process that did this was called \"nahimicSvc32.exe\".\n\nSo, I uninstalled Nahimic as completely as I could, ran CCleaner, restarted my Laptop and then found some cmd commands to help me write a quick batch script for closing any Nahimic processes that may be left.\n\nTo do that, open an empty notepad file and write the following:\n\necho on\ntitle LIVE setup: spring cleaning\necho echo Live SETUP\necho\necho Killing nasty processes\necho\ntaskkill /f /im \"NahimicService.exe\"\ntaskkill /f /im \"NahimicSvc32.exe\"\ntaskkill /f /im \"NahimicSvc64.exe\"\ntaskkill /f /im \"MSIService.exe\"\ntaskkill /f /im \"AGSService.exe\"\ntaskkill /f /im \"ShareX.exe\"\npause\n\nSave the file, remove the .txt and put .bat instead. Run that as administrator. I let that run every now and then, just to be sure.\n\nJust played a game and it was the first in like 4 days without any issues. Hope that helps someone else, since it took me like 3 days to figure all this out.","replies":[{"poster":"Rodinoce49","date":"2018-08-03T16:22:28.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty i m gona try that later","replies":[{"poster":"Tapehmwadsu","date":"2018-08-06T21:05:16.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are a lot of people having the same issue in France, nearly all with a specific internet service provider : Bouygues Telecom (i heard about another one too but it's a minority).\n\nBouygues Telecom users encontered similar issues with Fortnite (impossible to leave combat bus ^^') so people tend to blame them easily.\n\nRiot said nearly 2 mouths ago we should wait for a network intervention from the ISP but i am personnaly more looking for a patch from Riot because bug appeared with Aatrox's patch realase.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lovecrank","date":"2018-08-03T07:24:44.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A me dopo l'aggiornamento alla 8.15 il client è diventato lentissimo.","replies":[]}]}
