I UNDERSTAND, that it cannot be improved to be allowed past 3 minutes because then if you are losing you&#039;d just go afk and take minimal consequences (especially if playing with a premade, you can do this on turns) \r\n\r\n**BUT THERE IS A WAY TO IMPROVE IT EVEN MORE.**\r\n\r\nOkay so we all know how the report system works, \r\n1.  You Report Someone.\r\n2.  The person that you reported gets reported from many peaple cause it was really a toxic player.\r\n3.  Toxic player gets consequences, and you get that advice riot gives you that tells you they got consequences.\r\n\r\nNOW. I know a lot of peaple use reports randomly and that some 4 man premades reporting 1 player may disrupt this system **BUT**\r\n\r\n**WHAT IF WHEN YOU LOSE A RANKED MATCH BECAUSE SOMEONE ON THE TEAM HAD TOXIC BEHAVIOR, AND GOT CONSEQUENCES, YOU DON&#039;T LOSE LP / YOU LOSE LESS OF THEM?**\r\n\r\nObviously, to make the system fair, \r\n1. The player reported loses the most LP, Like with the /remake Mechanic.\r\n2. The winning team gets LESS LP, (like 10 or so) because even if they played well, it was an unfair match.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this idea? Please bump so riot reads this.\r\n\r\nOG Mistery, EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Linkimaru OP","date":"2016-10-24T15:14:14.777+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ti sei risposto da solo dicendo che è un sistema abusabile dai premade.\n\nQuesto è il forum italiano e ti rispondo in italiano :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2016-10-24T15:18:29.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abusable system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drìny II","date":"2016-10-24T15:15:30.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1 That's a good idea","replies":[]}]}
