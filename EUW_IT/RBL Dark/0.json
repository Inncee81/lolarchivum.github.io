I think it is a champion with a lot of potential but now I can not express it completely, I believe that the ulti should be faster in action and statistics (both of which motion attack) should be increased, with respect to the q I would say that it is perfect, but we aumenterei the duration of the damage and slightly to let him hurt even if the build does not allow a great physical harm to increase its life. I would say that could be a considerable improvement of the champ despite the skill should not be changed","replies":[{"poster":"vondarck","date":"2016-09-06T15:52:26.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the moment no bro..\n\nwhy?\n\nbecouse {{champion:80}} have strong kit (yeah, is old but \"gold\")\nanother champ in league of leggends need a rework pre panteon! ---->{{champion:6}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:266}} ","replies":[]}]}
