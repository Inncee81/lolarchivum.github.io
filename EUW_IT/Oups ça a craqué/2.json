Im currently looking for a caster who can stream the games.\n\nFor the moment we dont have the schedule but the games will be probably played the week-end.\n\nIt could be great if you could give us the videos of the games after the stream to upload it on YouTube or Dailymotion, or anything else.\n\nI&#039;ll edit this message sometimes, so keep an eye on this thread !\n\n[Link to the main thread](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/it/c/esport-it/bUWVEgv7-interforum-concorrenza)\n\nThanks to you ! :)\n\n\nEDIT : Dates have been written on the main thread.","replies":[]}
