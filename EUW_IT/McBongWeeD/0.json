However phaneon can be use in top lane and jungler but he has a mana dipendence.\nI recomand you to buy wukong. he is not easy to play early. His segret is to know how his W work. XD\nSo Have fun with Wukong's Juke XD","replies":[{"poster":"McBongWeeD","date":"2016-01-29T18:21:16.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I'll buy Wukong soon and I'll wait more time for Phanteon. \nWhat about Rengar? Is he worth or I should spend 6300 credits with another champion?","replies":[{"poster":"JollyJack360","date":"2016-01-29T18:28:15.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know maybe he will stay in to the jungler XD\ni think that riot whant to do the same think that they did to hecarim top.\nif you have 6300 ip i will wait, just to think:\nWhat is my lane?\nWhat is my secondary lane?\n What kind of champ i usually play? this ask is very important because in lol there are passive champions and aggressive champions...so you must know your style and then you make the chooise.\nRengar is not easy to play. Generally i recomand him into the jungler. Now with the new sistem of ranked you need a secondary role so if you wanna do the jungler buy him.\nHowever the first thing that you must consider is: this champ is funny for me? afther that do your choise.","replies":[{"poster":"McBongWeeD","date":"2016-01-29T19:35:56.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty man ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenArroww","date":"2016-01-29T18:33:23.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"nerfed\"","replies":[]}]}
