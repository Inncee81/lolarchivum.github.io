I just get  5 - 10 games with the worse teammates and really cocky enemies, I understand sometimes we get games we can&#039;t win, but i hate having to lose that much just because I lost once. Do you guys ever get that or am I just a crying kid? also I&#039;m sure i&#039;m not tilting, I have been playing this game for the last 4 years and from time to time i get this losing streaks even doe I feel like I&#039;m playing at a consistent level.","replies":[{"poster":"Ã„sha","date":"2016-10-19T11:58:21.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">or am I just a crying kid\n\nYou're not just a crying kid\nyou're a crying kid in the wrong server","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2016-10-19T08:16:33.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the italian board, people who write here are supposted to write in italian.\n\nAbout rankeds, I don't think there is any \"schema\". There are just winning streaks and losing streaks. You lose one, you are tilted and you think that you will lose also the next one because of \"bad teammates\". If you focus only on your playstyle instead of thinking \"omg I'll have bas teammates\" you will win more games.","replies":[]}]}
