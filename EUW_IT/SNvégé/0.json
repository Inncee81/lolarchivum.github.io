If you want to say \"hello\" you have to say \"Aho a cojone (Hello stupid guy)\", when you're angry with someone you usually say \"L'anima de li mortacci tua (this isn't easy to translate, it's could be translated with \"fuck your soul and your dead relatives\") but there are other less common ways. Remember to remove some final parts of the words to make them finish in \"a\" Listen for exemple rappers canesecco and gemitaiz, sbajà (getting wrong) tajà (getting me laugh a lot) etc.","replies":[{"poster":"SNvégé","date":"2018-04-11T18:59:15.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty so much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Giorgio di villa","date":"2018-04-11T08:08:37.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"This man is one of the biggest exponents of Italian culture\nhttps://youtu.be/GBACLpkon6Q","replies":[{"poster":"Völcanø","date":"2018-04-11T10:00:02.294+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Giorgio di villa,realm=EUW,application-id=MJVj50Jw,discussion-id=RhZNhsR1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-11T08:08:37.787+0000)\n>\n> This man is one of the biggest exponents of Italian culture\n> https://youtu.be/GBACLpkon6Q\n\nCredo sia inopportuno rispondere ad una richiesta seria linkando un video idiota","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Mac","date":"2018-04-15T13:35:09.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dialects cannot be learnt. Especially if you aim to two totally different linguistic stocks, the Calabrian and the Roman. The latter is fairly easier, but you could be better off just learning some of the common phrases you hear in most Italian movies. That said, there's no way to make sense out of them without a deep knowledge of Italian itself. Furthermore, most dialects' distinctive sounds (especially Southerns) cannot be written at all (at most, they can be approximated with IPA phonetics, which isn't easy at all to read for a beginner). \nTo give you an idea, if somebody from Naples tries to understand the dialect spoken in Caserta (which are less than 40 km apart, in the same region), they'll probably have a hard time \"decoding\" everything he's been told. And he'll never able to understand a word of Florence or Milan's dialects. \nSo, my suggestion is to just learn Italian if you're interested in the language (though I strongly suggest against it, there are way, way more useful languages out there): it's pretty similar to French, you shouldn't have too much of a hard time studying it. Then, once you become proficient, you can start researching on dialects, especially Roma's. But, as the others already pointed out, you first study a language in a formal, institutional way, then you can go further and deeper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tacchino Robot","date":"2018-04-11T10:16:16.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just shout \"AOOOOOOO!\" in every sentences and you are super romano","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Fluffy Lamb","date":"2018-04-12T10:26:59.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should learn italian first....","replies":[]},{"poster":"NOLIMIT Vladimir","date":"2018-04-12T08:50:36.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The roman dialect is my favourite for the way it sounds but the most famous all over the world is the Naples one.
