Pretty underrated too. Sure, you have lose dmg against monsters for the first 10 minutes, but i think the point was to prevent jungler to use this rune, since +100 hp at lvl 1 for free on a jungler (IN MY OPINION) is a bit too much. On support and tanks, however, it can make wonders, allowing you to be harder to be poked out of lane and allows you to create a bit more pressure. I heard people complaining about the passive gameplay this rune favors (or the fact that a simple stat boost is not fun) and i can somewhat understand it, but i think it&#039;s possible to work around this rune to make it worth it.\r\nI would advice something like this:\r\n\r\n+100 hp from the start, +X hp every minute after that (first bonus at minute 11)\r\n-10% dmg vs monsters until minute 10\r\n\r\nThis was suggested in another thread and i think this alone would help it make it worth for the tanks.\r\nAnother option (this one is mine) i can suggest is:\r\n\r\nGain 100 (+50 per stack) permanent hp. Earn a stack the first time you get a takedown on each enemy champion.\r\n-10% dmg against monsters until minute 10\r\n\r\nThis should make it a bit more interesting, capping at 350 hp once you get all the stacks. I&#039;m not too sure if it&#039;s a lot or not, but in case it is it&#039;s still possible to lower it to 25 hp per stack, reaching a total of 225 hp.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be:\r\n\r\n+10 max hp every minute (first bonus at 1 minute)\r\n-10% dmg vs monsters\r\nGain adaptive damage based on your total hp (0.5 AD or 1 AP every 100 hp)\r\n\r\nThis will open up some more build for the tanks, while helping supports with their skills. Let&#039;s suppose a Sona support reaches 2000 hp (extremely possible). That&#039;s 20 AP, which may not seem a lot, but it really helps. A tank with 3000 hp would gain 30 AP (or 15 AD).\r\n\r\n\r\nRune: Font of life\r\nEffect: Enemy champions whose movement you impair are marked for 4 seconds. Allied champions attacking marked targets regenerate 5 (+1% your max hp) over 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is a bit low by itself. Let&#039;s suppose you play a tank and reach 3.1k hp. That&#039;s 31 + 5 = 36 hp regenerated. Suppose half of that is regenerated immediately and the other half over 2 seconds. So 16 immediately, then 8, then 8 again. An ally hit the target 4 times over the course of the 4 seconds, resetting the 2 second duration.\r\n16 X 4 = 64\r\n8 X 4 = 32\r\n(here there is the next AA, which means only the last auto complete the 2 second regeneration time)\r\n8 X 1 = 8\r\n\r\nTotal is 104 hp. Sure, you can increase this with runes/items increasing the healing done, but let&#039;s work without those for a minute.\r\n104 hp in the span of 6 seconds (1 hit each second, 4 seconds mark, 2 seconds to complete the last regen cycle ) is 17.3333 hp/sec.\r\nSo, without items/runes that&#039;s not really something worth, especially if you consider that normally a tank can reach 3.1k hp near late game, where ADCs can dish out at least 2 times that dmg with a single AA.\r\nIn my opinion, this rune needs a small buff. Maybe something like 1 second regen instead of 2? Or increase the healing to 2.5% / 5% max hp depending if the owner is ranged or melee?\r\nWhat are your opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Floppyz","date":"2018-10-22T12:58:41.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mi dispiace, ma questo Ã¨ il forum italiano, per cui sono accettati unicamente topic in italiano.\n\nI'm sorry, this is the italian board, therefore only topic written in italian are allowed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Triplestarsystem","date":"2018-10-21T15:26:41.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nI do not agree with these runes. Tanky aggressive supports and top laners could gain too much advantage with these runes (they do not care at all about monster damage and still have all the advantage). Can you imagine these runes with Leona and Alistar? You could dive at level 2 and you completely shut down squishy support champions such as Sona, Zyra, Zilean and so on....","replies":[{"poster":"Dorante997","date":"2018-10-21T15:50:15.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i did repeat in the whole post that those are just my opinions and i admit i have shortcoming and lack of knowledge.
