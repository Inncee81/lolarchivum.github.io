RIP fun!","subforum":"Discussioni generali","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lagging is something that happens to anyone, from small players to big streamers. I was playing a normal draft as {{champion:23}}. Usually I lag but those lags are short with big intervals. That game was the opposite, obviously I got a little tilted for not being able to play like I normally do. I showed my ping to my team and after some time someone tipped in chat: &quot;if u have lags don&#039;t play&quot;. Some minutes later I tried to kill an Ezreal but I died since I can&#039;t use my abilities properly. That guy said: &quot;Tryndamere is too hard for u, u should play Yi, or easier champs&quot;. He said that after me saying multi times that I was lagging. Now I want to make a question for those guys that flame someone who&#039;s lagging in a normal draft. Do u think that I enjoy playing with high ping? Do u think I play in that condition to make u lose ur game? U think that flaming someone who&#039;s already tilted will make him feel better? Probably in message I seem like a kid that&#039;s crying for being flamed but, if anyone ignore this things, the problem will never be resolved. I could easily /mute all at the start of the game but I&#039;m not the type of guy that thinks like that. I like to make people think about what&#039;s wrong and what&#039;s right to make of this game an enjoyable experience for everyone. At the end of that game, after 35 minutes of tilt, some guys of my team scolded the flamer and that made me think that, after all, the League of legends community isn&#039;t that bad. I wanna thank&#039;s them for calming me down.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sky Striker Ace","date":"2018-04-13T20:26:43.866+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai sbagliato forum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eug il Cagnolino","date":"2018-04-13T21:18:00.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oppure lo spamma in giro per dire la sua, perch√® io me le farei 2 domande se entro nel forum e vedo 10 post in un altra lingua","replies":[]}]}
