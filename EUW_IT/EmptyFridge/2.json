I&#039;m a 21yo guy livin in Italy. I try to be not depressed but that&#039;s what I am, I have quit my job cause it was too stressful. Left my girlfriend still dunno why. I started playin lol since I wake till I fall asleep even in my chair. I&#039;m tryin to improve myself, id like to be part of a really good team one day but for I&#039;m just a stupid workless boy who plays pc hated by his own family. How can I make lol a job? I really need to money to keep on livin. I tried suicide about 3 months ago, I used to go to the psychiatrist but he didn&#039;t help me that much. Should I kill myself? Should I keep on playin lol? Should I just find a job and start livin that normal life everyone is searching? I can&#039;t find a job that I like, university too expensive for my family and still don&#039;t know if I can study or I like it. Hope to find a solution","replies":[{"poster":"ZZALA","date":"2016-08-20T18:21:30.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"RiScrivi in italiano il post , quitta lol per un po te lo consiglio .
