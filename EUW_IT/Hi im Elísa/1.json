[Low/Mid/High Diamond-Master]","subforum":"Reclutamento","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nMy name is Ungebildet and I&#039;m looking for a few **Scrim-Partners** between **Low Diamond and Master**.\r\nAs I manage 4-5 teams currently it&#039;s obviously hard sometimes to get a scrim for each of them for each time.\r\nSo, to make it easier to me and to other teams / their managers to find a scrim I&#039;m looking for a few more contacts that are reliable on and punctual teams.\r\n\r\n_That said I only want people to add me who are able to cancel a scrim not just 2 minutes before it begins and people who are able to note down when their scrim is gonna take place and not just &quot;forget about the deal&quot; they made._\r\n\r\nI can already tell that most scrims we&#039;re looking for should start at **6** or **7 PM CEST**.\r\nAlso, we **prefer non-German teams** to scrim against.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested please add me IG or post here so I&#039;ll add you.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nUngebildet\r\nTeam-Manager of AL and Tribunal eSports e.V.","replies":[]}
