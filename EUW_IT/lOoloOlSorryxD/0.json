When it&#039;s usually ~90-140. I even reinstalled whole OS on my PC. But nothing changed. All other games work fine(Witcher 3,WWE2k15, BF4) So i guess it&#039;s a patch flaw. Anyone else get same prob here?","replies":[{"poster":"ubercodlegend200","date":"2015-07-22T18:52:36.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"better ask to the support \n\np.s this isn't the english forum so so you must switch to the correct forum if u want a help in english ^.^","replies":[]}]}
