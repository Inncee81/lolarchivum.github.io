So here it goes, I&#039;m not gonna use precise numbers because I don&#039;t know much about balancing and every ability will have a little bit of explanation on why I think it fits pantheon fantasy.\n\nPassive: Ghost army\nWhenever pantheon hits an enemy champion with an ability a ghost warrior spawn near every nearby champion. The ghost warriors have the same health as pantheon but take more damage and go away if pantheon goes out of combat. Ghost warrior will auto the nearest champion to them and will mimic pantheon Q and W like {{champion:238}} shadows.\n\n*So pantheon is supposed to incarnate the classic Spartan archetype, and I think that one of the key element to it his the &quot;outnumbered&quot; thing of fighting against the odds and getting out triumphant. This ability not only gives a cool spin to pantheon (&quot;hey I have my own army of ghost warriors&quot;) while rewarding aggressive 1v5 all in*\n\nQ: Heartseeker strike\nPantheon trusts his spear in front of him dealing damage and slowing every unit hit. If more than one champ is hit the damage is increased and the ability stuns instead of slowing\n\n*This ability is pantheon bread and butter: it is his main harras and damage tool, again playing on the &quot;outnumbered&quot; theme by having its power amplified when hitting more enemy champion*\n\nW: Rankbreaker dash\nPantheon dashes forward with his shield up, while he dashes he breaks every projectile he encounters. When the dash ends pantheon will take reduced damage from the direction of the dash. If pantheon and one or more ghost warrior hit the same target he gets stunned\n\n*This ability is a pretty good restyling of his current W: the damage reduction is akin to his W resetting the passive, it has a stun (also situational even if simpler to proc than the Q stun) and the projectile breaking mechanics just screams &quot;gg outplayed&quot; for me* \n\nE: Ascended reincarnation\nThis ability has no cooldown but can be used only while at 30% or less health. The current pantheon sacrifice himself dealing damage around him based on how low he is. Then pantheon will reincarnate in the nearest ghost warrior. This ability doesn&#039;t spawn ghost warriors\n\n*This ability is the best for me: pantheon was the first targonian and as such the first to have this theme of being an incarnation (kinda like an avatar) of a bigger entity. Something that bugs me is how even if all targonian champs have this element of being an avatar of their aspects none of them express it in their kits. This ability execute on pantheon being the aspect who can incarnate over and over as his human vessels sacrifice themselves for the greater good. It is also pantheon main defensive ability, but having it gated behind having a ghost means that this ability still has an offensive element to it and ties with pantheon &quot;aggressive no matter the odds&quot; playstyle*   \n\nR: Grand Skyfall\nPantheon immediately goes into the sky becoming untargetable, he then can choose a location to land in. After a delay he lands dealing damage and slowing unit hit. If more than one champion are hit the damage is increased and the ability stuns\n\n*nothing much here: this is just a modenization of his current R. Making pantheon go up to the sky with the first cast means that this ability can be used while in fight to dodge and outplay and opponent skillshot. You also need to account that this new R would have a much smaller range and damage but much faster cast time. The problem with his current R for me is that it is often used just to get back to lane so you can take ignite top, this because his looooong cast time means that you are basically never gonna hit it. Having the cast time reduced at the expense of its damage and range would be a pretty good tradeoff for me*\n\nlet me know what you think, but try to be gentle as this is my first time doing this kind of stuff","replies":[{"poster":"wattbatt","date":"2018-07-11T14:54:41.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"e perch√® in inglese di preciso?","replies":[]}]}
