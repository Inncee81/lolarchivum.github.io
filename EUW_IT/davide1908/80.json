{"poster":"davide1908","date":"2016-10-05T14:07:28.907+0000","title":"Il ritorno dei Doom Bot","subforum":"Mappe e modalità","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Here&#039;s L4T3NCY with more info on the upcoming addition of of Doom Bots of Doom to the RGMQ, including several changes such as increasing difficulty, upgraded bots, and a new evil overlord:\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ffmz2AvDOas/V_QqoiBSHaI/AAAAAAAAVks/2W7JTTIJ81EjRxvUdex83CoF0_r5az7LACLcB/s1600/HLURp2k.jpg\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#039;s been a long time coming.. they&#039;ve been lurking... waiting... to be summoned... ..here comes the Doom Bots of Doom! \r\nWe&#039;ll be enabling them on the PBE soon(tm), and eventually they&#039;ll go into the RGM rotation. A LOT has changed from last time though, so I&#039;ll get straight to it. \r\nGame flow: \r\nBattle against the Doom Bots of Doom on an extra spooky Summoner&#039;s Rift in this survival style game mode.\r\nDoom Bots will rush your lanes relentlessly. Survive!\r\nTry to survive for 15 minutes until the Evil Overlord of the Doom Bots is summoned.\r\nDefeat him to win the game!\r\nLose your nexus and be doomed forever... \r\nOther gameplay notes: \r\nDoom bots don&#039;t go back to shop or heal, but when they do die they&#039;ll be back in lane before you know it.\r\nThe map has been cut in half so we could double down on the doom.\r\nEnemy towers are invulnerable. Don&#039;t bother trying to push.\r\nIn the event you manage to suicide some minions into an enemy tower, you&#039;ll receive burst of HP/mana for some sustain.\r\nUpon breaking certain kill &#039;quest&#039; thresholds, your team will receive a boost in power. Work together to get kills and power up in time. \r\nThe Doom Bots roster: \r\nOur bot roster has dramatically increased from last time! We have: \r\nAmumu\r\nAnnie\r\nBlitzcrank\r\nBrand\r\nChogath\r\nEzreal\r\nFiddlesticks\r\nGalio\r\nHeimerdinger\r\nLeona\r\nLulu\r\nLux\r\nMalzahar\r\nMorgana\r\nTristana\r\nUdyr\r\nVeigar\r\nWukong\r\nYasuo\r\nYorick\r\nZiggs \r\n\r\n▶Curses: \r\nCurses are global buffs that effect every Doom Bot (or the map itself). They rotate in randomly every few minutes and give the bots a variety of familiar (but scary) powers: \r\nCelestial Expansion\r\nTempered Fate\r\nGiga Blinding Dart\r\nBrush Fire :)\r\nDeath Defied\r\nRealm Warp\r\nElectrified Turrets :)\r\nWindwall\r\nTwilight Shroud\r\nDevilish Duplicates :)\r\nAegis Protection\r\nHallucination\r\nPoison Trail\r\nBlood Scent \r\n\r\n▶the Doom Bots&#039; Evil Overlord: \r\nHe who shall not be named.. \r\n\r\n▶Custom difficulty in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; mode: \r\nIn &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, we&#039;re letting YOU set the difficulty and choose how hard you want the Doom Bots to be when challenging them.\r\nSet a custom Doom Bots difficult from 1 - 100 at the start of the game to modify your Doom Bots.\r\nUse the chat command &quot;/votelevel ##&quot; and have 3 or more players vote for the same difficulty level to lock it in. (EG: /votelevel 65)\r\nIf a difficulty is not agreed on and voted for within 90sec, the mode will randomise a difficulty level.\r\nOn completion, your match history will show what level you completed as PROOF of your accomplishment (or demise).\r\nWe&#039;re interested to see what the highest level that any players in the WORLD can complete.\r\nThere will be an icon after the event for players that complete some of the highest possible levels compared to anyone else in the world. Get your squad together and see how far you can go. :) \r\n\r\n▶Known bugs: \r\nMode not yet fully optimised. Might be some particle slow down on lower end machines.\r\nSummoning ceremony still missing SFX. \r\nGiven the amount of content in Doom Bots, we expect there&#039;s probably quite a few bugs still lurking in there. Any help from you PBE peeps is always appreciated to catch those hard to find bugs. Thanks as always everyone. \r\nNow go get doomed. :) \r\n-- L4T3NCY&quot;\r\n\r\n▶When asked if DOOM BOTS will award mastery points while up in the RGMQ, RiotTerra commented:\r\n&quot;You don&#039;t get champion mastery points in any Co-op vs AI mode, so unfortunately you won&#039;t get any points for Doom Bots of Doom.&quot;\r\nAs for the player voted difficulty system, Riot Stephiroth  added:\r\n&quot;Quote:\r\nI would definitely reconsider the method the players use to choose the difficulty. At least average the votes if there isn&#039;t a majority so the 5 people who can&#039;t decide between 11, 15 and 13 aren&#039;t handed 82.\r\nWe are planning to have upper/lower bounding to the votes (when there&#039;s a large disagreement on votes), so that you don&#039;t get stuck with some super duper insane :) Because there will likely be some insane things in the uppermost levels.\r\nWe&#039;re thinking about this! But thanks for bringing it up! :)&quot;\r\nWhen asked for more information on how the curses work, Riot Stephiroth commented:\r\n&quot;Quote:\r\nHow are the Curses going to work? I know that they affect the Bots. But how? Are they debuffs or buffs? Or just random stuff they get?\r\nIt varies between the types of curse :) Some go on the bot and help them out, some effect various areas on the map, etc. \r\nThey are all assigned to a bot, though, so you can see it once it&#039;s assigned (and also there&#039;s a chat call-out!)&quot;\r\n\r\n▶Riot Stephiroth also commented on the removal of Karthus bot:\r\n&quot;Quote:\r\nWhat happened to Karthus bot?\r\nKarthus bot was in a weird state; so we&#039;ve instead converted his most doomy-ability, his passive, to a curse. So bots will randomly become Karthus Passivey-ghosties while Death Defied curse is active. :3&quot;\r\nAs for when Doom Bots will be enabled on the PBE, Riot Stephiroth noted:\r\n&quot;Quote:\r\nDo we have an estimation on when this will hit PBE at all?\r\nsoon(tm). \r\nBut really, we&#039;re hoping for tomorrow or Thursday but we&#039;re still fixing up some major issues so it may vary!&quot;\r\n\r\n▶Through the in-game strings it appears DEVIL TEEMO will be the Doom Bots new evil overlord.\r\n Text countdown timer - ex:&quot;10 minutes before HE arrives...&quot; and &quot;1 minute left! Your end is nigh!&quot;\r\n&quot;The Teemoing has begun!&quot;\r\n &quot;Destroy Devil Teemo to stop The Teemoing!&quot;\r\nLittle Devil (Teemo): What?! My servants haven&#039;t destroyed you yet?&quot;\r\nThat&#039;s not all though, there are also a slew of text chat lines from Teemo to announce the various doombots abilities,  curses,  etc\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a list of the various doom bots and their doom abilities:\r\n\r\n▶Amumu:\r\n Doom of the Sad Mummy -
