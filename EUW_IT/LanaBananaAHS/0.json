for behavior. &lt;br&gt;\r\nsince that day i keept thinking on what i did and why it was that toxic. i really didnt know the gravity of what i said , i was simple joking with a friend and meaning to make fun in the lobby but i has been annoying in chat.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\ni love this game and enjoyed it so much, i supported you as well cuz i think you make a good job on features and on behavior of players (except for inting which sadly still in the game) .i know a player that got unbanned from permaban and he said things like &quot;kys&quot; &quot;pleb&quot; and so on.i always has been a competitive player,never surrended and never told someone to kill them self or similar.i said a bad racism word on purpuose of make fun but using the forum i noticed how much bad that word is.i also noticed that &quot;gj&quot; and &quot;gg easy&quot; are considered negative words by the system.i also forgot caps lock on sometimes i think system misunderstood some of my meanings. im not saying i didnt flame, and im not saying i dont deserve a ban/limitation, im only saying that permanent one may its too much,and if you think 14 days isnt enought, well i passed 2 months thinking on what i done looking my chat log.i just typed too much but thats because im fast, i still paying while typing&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nmy friend made fun of me, i didnt enjoy all your events missions and new skins, i has been over 2 months in the little corner of the room thinking on what i done.i cant believe you think stay in this forever would resolve the problem,but somehow it did but i wanna prove that by showing you my reform.i know you probably asking me to make a new account, well 3 ppl already gave me them account lv 100 with over 30 skins, but its not the same thing, i dont like to lie , as i did with you i always tell what i think and ask to resolve problems.but i learned the lesson , i dont have to use chat anymore &lt;br&gt;\r\neven if i think thats a big waste,ill never use chat again since even if you say gj 5 times u being annoying in chat. ima really changed person i changed way to think and way to play. but create an account isnt possible for me, i really get depressed everytime i play league since that day its literally like im IP-banned.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nas i said,i didnt know the gravity of what i said and i just wanted to make a laugh with some friends, but i miserably failed. &lt;br&gt;\r\nso,im there pleasing you to forgive me.pls riot review this:&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nGame 1 &lt;br&gt;\r\nIn-Game &lt;br&gt;\r\nLanaBananaAHS:

not &lt;br&gt;\r\nLanaBananaAHS: u are &lt;br&gt;\r\nLanaBananaAHS: ty ahri &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nas i said,im not feeling unfair-banned and im not playing the role of the bulled boy saying everyone target me,i know i did wrong and i deserved a ban/limitation&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nthe 2 week ban was on 20 of june and i really believed to be reformed and i didnt believe system could permaban me after i reached honor lv 1. &lt;br&gt;\r\nim not trying to justify me and im not saying every player would have do that, i know i didnt have to use chat (even if i think its a waste keep ppl flaming on chat without try let them think on what they are doing)and simple mute all.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nas i said im not saying the ban system do not work well, im only saying in that case some of my phrase could get misunderstood and (as some players told me ) 14 days ban was enought. &lt;br&gt;\r\nNOW i know that even if i feel offended i have to mute all and dont reply (even if i hate stay with hands in my hands and wait to someone help me, it just let me feel weak i got bullying problems in the past and after lessons i learned that i have to reply if dont want the other to put them feet on my head. but NOW i&amp;apos;ll just do what riot ask me and even if i think thats the wrong way ,i&amp;apos;ll do it )&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\ni know league is a free-to-play game,and (as i can see) im not forcing you to give me my account back ,im simple saying since i supported you by calling my friends (that actually spent 600 &euro; on this game) and supported you as well with my money and since i tried to do what riot forum should me to do , i never surrended and never stopped playing trying to go on without get tilt.im saying, since i supported you very well,why arent you collaborating with me&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\ni feel im reformed but, create a new account it does not make sense let me explain why (yeah im talking like a rioter sry for this belief,but i hope this can help you on making a new permaban mechanics,):&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n-making a new account does not give me back my skins, my friends list,my mastery points but most importantly nobody will ever care about check my reform, i mean even reaching honor 5 i wont get riot congratulations or any reward related to my old account. for example &lt;br&gt;\r\nif making a new account and reaching honor 5 could get my account back, i would immediately go play league again .same if i could get back my money/skins on the new account .&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nthis is what would engage ppl to reform .meanwhile knowing i cant get back my account just make me feel bad ,unistall league,and go play another game&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nanother reason of why im not making a new account is: &lt;br&gt;\r\nmaking a new account every ppl i meet make fun of me (and reading to your private policy thats not exactly what you want right?)even my friends i called on this game made fun of me (and considerating they tilt every game i dont get why they are honor 5, the only thing they do is to make fun of EVERY player they meet and tilt when they die, but since they are honor 5 i think thats exactly what riot want them to do)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nanother reason is: since its always me playing, where is the meaning of dont giv eme my account back, it still me playing the only thing that change is the angry of playing without old stuff (which mean more flammers will born instead of new reformed guys)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nyou dont have to sorry, im not upset to you but theres one thing you can do sent this to the player behavior specialist so they can review this.and as i said i know what i did wrong,im happy you used your time to explain me , but i already knew.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\ni hope i explained myself&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nThank in advice for

un post in inglese ( anche se di inglese ha poco ) rivolto per metà alla riot, sul forum italiano dove non girano rioter?\nScrivi un ticket alla riot se vuoi spiegazioni o hai delle proposte che reputi interessanti, oppure scrivi un post in italiano in cui esponi le tue idee e cerchi un confronto con la community italiana.\nDetto ciò, avevi ricevuto già punizioni in passato, probabilemente per arrivare ai 20 giorni di ban eri passato per chat ristrette e altri brevi ban. Conoscendo ciò, potevi sicuramente comportarti meglio e mutare tutti. La riot è molto chiara sulle modalità di ban o chat ristrette. Eri già in una situazione a rischio e hai continuato a flammare. Insomma, te la sei cercata, ed ora è inutile lamentarsi.\nSe avessi letto il contratto che hai sottoscritto quando hai iniziato a giocare, avresti saputo che l'account e tutto ciò che lo riguarda non ti appartiene. Se decidi di spendere soldi sul game, dovresti sapere quali sono i rischi nel farlo. \nLa riot ti permette di giocare gratuitamente ad un gioco che, per quanto si possa criticare, rimane uno dei migliori del suo genere. \nL'unica cosa che chiede in cambio è un comportamento rispettoso. \n\nPs:\n\"i got bullying problems in the past and after lessons i learned that i have to reply if dont want the other to put them feet on my head.\"\ndiventare un bullo per non essere bullizzati è sicuramente la cosa più sbagliata che si possa fare in queste situazioni, a mio parere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mangialavandini","date":"2018-11-05T16:21:06.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/it/c/aiuto-e-supporto-it/Tk008IME-permaban\n\nChe ti dobbiamo dire? \n\nBro sei de coccio","replies":[]}]}
