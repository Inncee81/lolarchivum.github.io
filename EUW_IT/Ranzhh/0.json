It's been like this since patch 5.22, 5.23 maybe. I'm not really sure. I play on EUW.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsi4mpp5iPM&feature=youtu.be","image":null},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi. I&#039;ve been afflicted by this bug for quite a while now, i always hoped it was something with my current client and that upcoming patches would&#039;ve solved that but it didn&#039;t happen. Basically, when I try to spectate a game it loads, waits a couple seconds and kicks me telling me i disconnected. This happens both if I click something or if Istay absolutely still, not even moving the mouse, it doesn&#039;t matter. BaronReplays loads replays just fine. I&#039;m on EUW, my IGN is Ranzhh; I&#039;d like you to help me if you can spare some time! \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatteo","replies":[{"poster":"Chroniicles","date":"2016-02-02T09:03:53.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nthanks for the feedback, but we are in the italian forum, you must speak italian there ^^\nPlease, use the english forum from now, this topic will be closed.\n\nRegards","replies":[]}]}
