Along with the spread of popularity of LoL, new site and place have been born, quite willing to help players to learn aboutn the game!..but they dont share the same information, and sometimes give opposite message. So in time, informations that i though  i have mastered are now beign tested. Speaking with other players give me no results, cause everybody have learn from a different \"text book\" and claim his information to be the right one. \r\n\r\nSo here i am asking some random stuff to the comunity, and also wondering: there is an OFFICIAL place where ALL the rule are up to date?\r\n\r\n-One thing that i quickly learned in the far 2012 is that you DONT have to take your ADC kills, or ELSE!(Kill steal report!! report report!...ah...good old nightmarish time..) so..at the time i simply though : who makes the kill will recive more exp and gold than  who simply \"Assist\" him in the action.\r\n\r\nbuuuuut i lately found out in another site that...no matter WHO pick the kill. The bounty and the expirience will be split toward all the champions involved in the action. the only real exception is the jungle monsters. Soooooo theorically if a champion is worth 100gold and 100 experience and the adc and support kills him they got 50 gold and 50 exp each, regardless on WHO kills that champ.\r\n\r\nIs this REAL? and if it IS...why there is so much fuss around on WHO picks the kill?? \r\n\r\n-Still on experience... i cant really understand it on how it works.. almost every game the enemy team score the level before me...even when they got less minions, kills and stay less time in lane than me.. \r\nto be fair, i simply though \" i'm probably just walking j on the edge, a litle to far away from  minions when they die, and i did recive less experience..thats all! \"\r\nbuuuuuuuut... i also see my adc  usually stay one lvl behind... and have way more crits than the enemies (and sometimes he also got a kill or an assist...and the enemies...Dont!)\r\nso here im clearly missing something but i cant figure it out WHAT exactly...\r\n\r\n-Ranked. every season there is a lil ranked change, but everytime i look around i just get confused by mixed informations... so here i got 2 main questions\r\n\r\n-Ranked loss shield, it is true? and how it works ? (yes i know ranked is over,im just really curious about that)\r\n\r\n-Last time i cheked, if you are above gold, you have to keep playng ranked, or slowly losing your progress and eventually, be demoted.\r\nPlatinium division, was suppose to make at least a game at month, while diamond a game a  week.\r\nbuuuuuuuut i got a couple of friends that reach platinium around april...and totally stop playng ranked or stopping AT ALL (some got kids, so they have too...poor bastards..) and they keep theyr rank positions. they  claim that the rules have been changed..but i cant find this \"change\" anywere, so how it is?","replies":[{"poster":"Ω Hallelujah Ω","date":"2019-11-23T17:54:49.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.
