Phrases such as &quot;I cannot win because my team feeds 24/7&quot; or &quot;I only have afks and feeders in every game&quot; come from bronze players. The sooner you realize that it&#039;s your fault that you&#039;re in bronze, the faster you&#039;ll get out of it. You have to work on yourself, because then you will be able to carry your Team. Otherwise, you will not move an inch from bronze away.\r\nBut ey, listen guys, i gotcha ya back. I will give you now few tips that will help you to improve and get you out of bronze.\r\nSo, if you want to climb, you either have to pick few champions that suit you or you choose a champion and become an onetrick pony. This means you know every matchup with this specific Chamiopn and know exactly what its abilities cause.\r\n- Many bronze players give up very early. The thing is, in a normal game they never give up and sometimes the game goes 50 minutes and they still go for it, but in a ranked game the FF call comes after 10 minutes or even earlier. Therefore, I would recommend you to pick strong Earlychampions. If you pick Lategame Champions you run the risk of not reaching the Lategame.\r\nWinning a Lane means not killing your opponent several times. No! The lane is already won, if you have farmed a lot of Minions. Therefore, focus on farming and you will have the most gold by simply farming. Create a Costumgame and practice there the lasthitting or the so-called Wavemanagement. When to freeze a Lane, when to push and so on.\r\nAlso many Bronzeplayers pick the wrong Runes. Match the runes to your champion and create multiple rune pages for specific situations. For example, if you play against a Full AD team, you do not need the MR rune &quot;Mirror Shell&quot;. Instead you go for the Armor Rune &quot;Iron Skin&quot;. Just look at guides on the internet or ask me in the comments. You can also twitter me. I will answer in any case.\r\n-The last tip is, Just look at yourself. The team does not matter. If you die, it was your fault. Just look at you right now and try to figure out what you did wrong and not what the team did wrong. Just go back and watch the Replay of your game and try to figure out your mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Pellah","date":"2018-01-13T17:26:42.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All'inizio pensavo fosse un flame sulle girl gamer, ora ho capito tutto xD","replies":[{"poster":"FireM1nd","date":"2018-01-13T17:38:46.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quando si dice \"pubblicitÃ  ingannevole\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CasualNoobITA","date":"2018-01-13T18:18:14.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One, if not the only guide I've read that is really useful.\nIn the past Gold arrived exactly following these steps.\nCompliments !\n\nUna , se non l'unica guida che abbia letto che sia davvero utile .\nIn passato sono arrivato Gold seguendo esattamente questi passaggi .\nComplimenti !","replies":[]}]}
