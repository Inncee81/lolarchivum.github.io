These last months ive been raging so much and i intentional lost a lot of games, i also flamed, insulted, mistreated, afked and intentional fed.\r\nThe most important thing that everyone must know is that i havent got baned.\r\nYou all must know that RIOT games doesnt care about their players, as you can deduce from the fact that a player like me who have been extremely toxic for a lot of months and for more than 100 games is still playing this game without ANY consequence.\r\n\r\nI dont want to be baned, but my moral and my justice sense makes me write this post. Because my own happiness is nothign compared to the happiness of an entire game comunity.\r\n\r\nRIOT please, i am one of the most toxic players in this game and im begging you to start caring about your players and puting JUSTICE to this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hàvòc","date":"2016-05-27T09:24:50.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got permabanned because i were toxic for a long time. I was like you, i tought that riot system doesn't work well and then i continued raging and flaming every game where my team did some mistakes... Then went the moment when i was so toxic for the community and riot permabanned me, they did right, because toxic players must be deleted from lol. Now i started playing with a new account and i mute everyone that i meet in my games so i can't read them and can't answer to their senteces. Be happy and stop being toxic untill you'll be punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NiraBlade","date":"2016-05-27T09:02:39.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the IT forum plus is not permitted to double post in different sections. \n---\nReturning to the problem why don't you give us more data, for example the frequency you'd raged (every game/ 2 times per week/ breaks or not/ ecc). Imho you should prove what you're saying, because anyone can state this sentence and without some demonstration is quite difficult to access if what you're saying matches with your \"fire games\". \n---\nYou can post screens of yourself raging to prove your point but you can't do name & shame - aka posting screens of others raging and such (delete their names with paint for example). Also don't talk bad of others with their names - i.e. \"PincoPallino raged and flamed so bad, flamers are everywhere\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Liorenato","date":"2016-05-27T09:41:09.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ma con quale uso delle doppie.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sorcio84","date":"2016-05-27T09:07:42.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No report to the police, no problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedmasterITA","date":"2016-05-27T18:16:42.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu4uVh-rUrg\n\nFells bad man .","replies":[]}]}
