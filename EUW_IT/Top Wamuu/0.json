In patch 9.6 Riven had a positive win rate in gold and a pretty negative win rate in silver despite having a really large play rate overall. Now, in patch 9.7 she has a positive win rate and a high play rate from silver to challenger itself meanwhile her ban rate is pretty low in low elos. The player base of lol positioned from silver to gold is about the 76-77%. I can't believe anymore to the story of being her \"not broken enough for a nerf\" like a rioter said in a post on reddit weeks ago.\r\nSo, let's talk clearly here: she fits well in any teamcomp, she is an assassin-bruiser-tank-dps monster, the frustration of playing against her is insane and she has not a bad point of the game regardless the items like other top laners in the same class (for example: renekton falls off in late game, darius is easy kitable and zoned in late game, jax is really bad in early game and he does not have the answers for everything till level 6 and even after that he's pretty possible to fight against). \r\nAre we saying the problems are runes and items and not HER sinergysing too good with them? First things first, runes are not the problem: cause every champion in top lane that uses conqueror should not be punished because her (and jax) are too good with it. The niche items she uses as core build could be the problem thou: spear of shojin is too good on her (and we are talking about jax...), we must admit it. \r\nSo, what is the next move, BalanceTeam-Senpai, can we nerf her kit/core items or giving her a point in the game were her kit/build falls off?\r\nWhat do you think guys, is your thought similar to mine? Have I kind of exaggerated and she is fine right now according to your experience? \r\nI know only one thing from direct experience: She is a real pain to play against, no matter what champion you are playing in top.","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelion Shmoll","date":"2019-04-09T09:03:00.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"who even consider low elo?","replies":[{"poster":"Top Wamuu","date":"2019-04-09T09:13:00.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Loli owner,realm=EUW,application-id=cAOZwaUi,discussion-id=3yjKGpKM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-04-09T09:03:00.935+0000)\n>\n> who even consider low elo?\n\n* Riot used low elo as a sort of excuse for not nerfing  her . Riven is actually really played and strong in high elo at the point of be considered busted . According to Riot itself, the one big reason she was not nerfed back in the day of the post on reddit was because she was not good \"overall\" meaning that the majority  of the League playerbase (that is stuck between silver and gold elos) was not seeingher as broken as high elo players were seeing  her. But now, you know, she is good also in silver so.. The entire point of Riot about not nerfing her is gone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Croffins","date":"2019-04-08T22:50:47.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]}]}
