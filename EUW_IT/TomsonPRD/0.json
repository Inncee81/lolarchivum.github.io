I tried everything: doing all the passages from this useless page D: (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944), reinstalling LoL, changing my MAC address, repairing it from the launcher. \r\nI don&#039;t have a router because I&#039;m directly connected to the Internet via LAN, so I don&#039;t even know if a port forward can be made nor how. I thought it would have been only a matter of hours, but the situation didn&#039;t slightly change. I can&#039;t even imagine different solutions. \r\nI even tried using the terminal &quot;_ping pvp.net_&quot; command as admin but the packages went all lost and the requests were always timed out (I&#039;ve tried that on another computer (iMac) too and the answer was always the same so it isn&#039;t a Pc problem). It worked well for 3 years and now I can&#039;t even play.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows hot to fix this (I&#039;ve tried all solutions so other forum discussions are useless for this case), or how to directly port forward a network interface controller, please save me. Asks everything you want if you need something.","replies":[{"poster":"FaFFe","date":"2015-08-12T20:54:46.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, we are in the italian forum so you can speak italian if you want.\nDid you change the DNS?
