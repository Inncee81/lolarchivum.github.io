His unshakeable thirst of knowledge saved many lives. But one day a deadly, traumatic event corrupted his soul and his will. Now is nothing but a twisted shelter of what he once was. Driven by insaity, he now spreads the palgues he once fought. From doctor to infector, his benevolence has been replaced by a sinister sadism and all his knowledges are now used to develop evolved plagues. Undead, he now wanders day and night to spread his deseases while two crimson glows emerge from the mask.\n\nNow, let&#039;s talk about his abilities. I was trying to make this champion unique in order to find him a place inside the League. I made it by focusing on 2 aspects: sinergy among his abilities, hardcore kind of gameplay who force the player to improve his knowledge about this champ in order to create different strategies or to defend himself from them. You will understand in a second.\n\nPASSIVE: QUARANTINE ZONE\nJust think about this: no passive in Lol affect the enemy&#039;s ability cost. The only debuffing passives only affect armor or mag res. That&#039;s why i mad this passive.\nI planned it with a range from a mid tower range to the opposite tower&#039;s one and it will increase the cost of the enemy abilities casted in this area by a percentage:\nMana/rage/health/focus/energy-based abilities will have anincreased cost;\nFree abilities will start to cost an health percentage based on the Max health amount.\nThis will create a revolutionary kind of gameplay forcing the enemy to show some caution in his casting.\n\nQ: RESILIENT PLAGUE\nAp-based Dot which deals magic damage. Medium-long range, istant cast, single target, medium cd, lasts 5 seconds. Mortimer gains armor and mag res for each infected target, up to a max. of 6 targets. If a target dies when the RESILIENT PLAGUE is active, mortimer heals for a percentage of the enemy max health (double percentage if the dead target is a champion).\n\nW: OUTBREAK OF INFECTION/ VIRULENCE\nOUTBREAK OF INFECTION (active ability): Motimer places an infected receptacle on the current location. This objest is motionless, invisible and so it remains untill an enemy aproaches. If and enemy TOUCHES it, the receptacle triggers and automaticaly infects the enemy with RESILIENT PLAGUE (Q) AND CRIPPLING PLAGUE (E). Then it starts darting bolts of infected humor up to 3 nearby enemies (mid-low range and giving priority to enemy champs). a receptacle survives up to 10 minutes when inactive or 6 seconds from its activation. Only 8 receptacles can be active at the same time and only 3 can be stored. This ability has a med-low cd.\nVIRULENCE (passive ability): Mortimer PLAGUES (Q and E) are now more infectious. They can now transmit by touch to every enemy who TOUCHES the infected host. From now on, Mortimer&#039;s ally units can be targeted by his PLAGUES becoming healty carriers, these allies will receive no damage and no PLAUGUE&#039;S secondary effect will be counted.\n\nE: CRIPPLING PLAGUE\nAp- based Dot which deals magic damage. Medium-long range, istant cast, single target, medium cd, lasts 5 secs. The infected target is slowed by 50% for the duration of the PLAGUE. If the target dies when the CRIPPLING PLAGUE is active, Mortimer gains the same abount as increased mov. speed.\n\nR: SEPTICEMIA/ EVOLVED DESEASES\nSEPTICEMIA (active ability): Mortimer quicken the infective process on a single champion causing a deadly Septicemia. The enemy takes istant pure damage (med damage). Then, for 8 seconds after that, PLAGUES deal 20% increased damage, lasts 50% longer and all their secondary effects are doubled. Med-high cd.\nEVOLVED DESEASES (passive ability): PLAGUES are now enough evolvd to be transmitted by via air. The contagion range is now increased per level of the Ultimate. In addition, now the INFECTED RECEPTACLE eplodes at the end of its duration, dealing magic damage in the area.\n\nFrom these ablities emerges a champion who must consider how and where to place his receptacles in order to optimize his chance to infect the enemy. A champ who intdoduces the unique mechanics of contagion, evolving deseases, enemy debuffing and deep ebility sinergies. It is not meant to be an easy champ (low burst damage and med-high cds), but a champ for skilled players who want to try something totally different and see if their choices of gameplay will eventually spread the infection.\n\ni hope u like what i created. I&#039;m waiting for your opinions and for an answer from a rioter XD.\n","replies":[{"poster":"kirchhoff","date":"2015-05-06T11:30:00.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ma è la seconda volta che passa di qua questo thread?","replies":[{"poster":"Nibbio Bianco","date":"2015-05-06T11:39:01.388+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kirchhoff,realm=EUW,application-id=P9Wi6QlB,discussion-id=AEMQlMbb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-06T11:30:00.811+0000)\n>\n> Ma è la seconda volta che passa di qua questo thread?\n\nNo, è la terza.
