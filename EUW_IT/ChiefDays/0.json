The enemy team picked it.\r\nI was like:&quot;Oh well, it&#039;s just a champ, surely it can&#039;t 1 v 5 us..&quot; man, only if i could&#039;ve dodged this match..\r\n\r\nSo what happened next? The mid lane was ours but then somehow he got a kill on Top Lane and that&#039;s where it went down..\r\nI was botlane, farming like no tomorrow, won my lane and in mid game that swain was literally tanking every spell and the funny thing is he was AP.\r\n\r\nWe had a chance since i got fed in bot lane but this guy literally murdered our tank and took our 2 mid towers down.\r\n\r\nThey started split pushing, all lanes had no turrets(expect for nexus turrets)  and in late game.. Swain suddently came alone so we decided to engage on him..\r\n\r\nThe fight lasted for around 40 secs, he kept regaining health and was literally unkillable.\r\nOur allies kept dying and Swain.. Still alive with his goddamn broken ult.\r\n\r\nHe ended up dying but right before he died this message appeared in chat: &quot;The enemy has slained the Baron&quot;.\r\n\r\nWe were 3, they were 4 and you can guess how it ended up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous how can a goddamn champ like that haven&#039;t gotten any SERIOUS nerfs.\r\nLesson of the story: Ban Swain.\r\n\r\nPS. I don&#039;t know if this is the right section since i&#039;m not familar with LoL forums.","replies":[{"poster":"zYaichi","date":"2016-08-05T19:55:54.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Questo è il forum italiano quindi dovresti scrivere in italiano","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kòro","date":"2016-08-05T19:53:44.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3033}} {{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"Giorgio di villa","date":"2016-08-05T21:36:43.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3165}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2016-08-06T03:26:27.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi dude this is the Italian board.
