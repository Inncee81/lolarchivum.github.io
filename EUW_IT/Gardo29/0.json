Definitely not any time soon. I would not put money on it being this year.\"\n\"We don't have a kit. We had a number of kits we were trying back in the day, but none of them worked out. This is completely normal for a champion (both Azir and Lucian had a number of kits previous to me starting work on them that didn't work out; my first kits for them also got scrapped, including Lucian's infamous homing missile ult and Azir's \"just summon 7 fully controllable soldiers\" ult). Game design is a highly iterative process. The only mistake we made with Ao Shin was that we talked about him way too early in that process, when we weren't yet sure how close to done we were.\nAs for Azir, the additional time we would have needed on him was toward the end, when you polish and fix bugs. That's very different.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"LionHeartV","date":"2015-05-13T20:23:30.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Allora ao shin quando esce?","replies":[]}]}
