I received chat restriction almost 2 years ago and since then i've never made any infraction at all. Then i got this ban out of the blue, with no previous warning or punishment. I'm being permabanned after receving 6 reports in 30 games, and specifically for this single chat log: Game 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nSkylor93: invade\r\nSkylor93: i agree\r\nSkylor93: &lt;3\r\nSkylor93: no more chat from me\r\nSkylor93: ...\r\nSkylor93: ...\r\nSkylor93: why?\r\nSkylor93: warded\r\nSkylor93: REALLY\r\nSkylor93: SHYVANA\r\nSkylor93: YOU NEED MANA\r\nSkylor93: bait\r\nSkylor93: syìnhyva\r\nSkylor93: team?\r\nSkylor93: SERIOUSLY\r\nSkylor93: team?\r\nSkylor93: adc missing\r\nSkylor93: and you go for fight\r\nSkylor93: brand missing...\r\nSkylor93: brand solo top\r\nSkylor93: just why?\r\nSkylor93: FOR %%%% SAKE\r\nSkylor93: WHY IS BRAND SOLO TOP?\r\nSkylor93: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE\r\nSkylor93: OF SUPPORT\r\nSkylor93: SOLO TOP\r\nSkylor93: DON'T GO DIE AS 2 NOW\r\nSkylor93: GG\r\nSkylor93: gg trist\r\nSkylor93: nice idea\r\nSkylor93: reported\r\nSkylor93: report tristana pls\r\nSkylor93: sure\r\nSkylor93: enjoy ban\r\nSkylor93: kid\r\nSkylor93: 1 thing\r\nSkylor93: you just suicide\r\nSkylor93: as carry\r\nSkylor93: in late game\r\nSkylor93: for no reason\r\nSkylor93: 1v4\r\nSkylor93: lol im wastin my time\r\nSkylor93: just get banned\r\nSkylor93: bye\r\nSkylor93: reported\r\nSkylor93: and muted\r\nSkylor93: nice foucs ppl\r\nSkylor93: adc solo\r\nSkylor93: new build\r\nSkylor93: never as 5\r\nSkylor93: brand and trist always alone\r\nSkylor93: go bac k to wood\r\nSkylor93: at min 40?\r\nSkylor93: brand seroisu\r\nSkylor93: bait\r\nSkylor93: just report botlane please\r\nSkylor93: trolling\r\nSkylor93: nice fight\r\nSkylor93: stfu\r\nSkylor93: 0 teamfight\r\nSkylor93: as support\r\nSkylor93: and only feed\r\nSkylor93: never with team\r\nSkylor93: brand and tristana\r\nSkylor93: you cant play\r\nSkylor93: sure\r\nSkylor93: with brand...\r\nSkylor93: ahahaha\r\nSkylor93: again no with team\r\nSkylor93: e\r\nSkylor93: if adc doesnt follow\r\nSkylor93: you cant take structures\r\nSkylor93: shyv\r\nSkylor93: defending adc\r\nSkylor93: main\r\nSkylor93: like you can stop him 1v1\r\nSkylor93: tristana and brand premade?\r\nSkylor93: would explain a lot\r\nSkylor93: they not coming\r\nSkylor93: look\r\nSkylor93: nice dive\r\nSkylor93: brand still base\r\nSkylor93: we cant even win if we ace\r\nSkylor93: 3v5\r\nSkylor93: bot lane better as afk\r\nSkylor93: gg report botlane please\r\nSkylor93: troll all game\r\nSkylor93: and toxic\r\n\r\nI know i lost it, okay. But seriously permaban? After 2 years? This was a ranked game and you can't see the other players messages, but i can assure you i got insulted heavily and in more than one occasion. I've being trying to keep it chill since the beginning, but after being insulted multiple times and noticing no cooperation and trolling on purpose by 2 other players, i've started declaring my intention to report them. Is this a factor that leads you to punishment? If that's the case, i wasn't really aware of it. Anyway i think this is an excessive punishment, i mean i know i was angry, but this chatlog doesn't seem that extreme to me, also no previous punishments in the last 2 years and this are 10 years of my life right here. I dont want to lose them like this. I have a lot of memories in this one and only account of mine and im still an active player with many friends in this community. I'm also usually a chill player who tries to keep things calm and enjoys other players company, and this situation just makes it even more shocking to me. Support service answered my ticket with a cold and detached answer, saying that permaban are irreversible and there's nothing that can be done, and i'm pretty sure no one really cared about my mails, or read them for real. Am i crazy thinking that this seems a little too much? I mean taking my account from me forever after 2 years of no restricions or anything for this single chatlog? And is it that bad? Anyone help me please, this makes me feel so sad and i don't wanna give up on this game. The loss of this account would be a fatal wound for me and just the memory of all these years gone for nothing would never allow me to create a new account a keep playing, just pretending like nothing ever happened.
