It doesn&#039;t even remove enemy &quot;dot&quot; damage, (like Teemo&#039;s)\n\nBUT MOSTLY IMPORTANT: Make it worth to get 4 stacks of E. Getting 4 stacks of E is hard to achieve until you have all the spell vamps items you need. It costs health, takes time and the buff vanishes slowly. Yes it gives &quot;increased health regeneration and more attack damage&quot; but i don&#039;t think it&#039;s such a great deal.\nI was thinking of giving him a _&quot;True Vampire Form&quot;_. Aesthetically, it would something like this http://http://imgur.com/6c5LmM6\nThe True Vamprie Form could give him some attack speed to go along with the E increased attack damage buff. Nothing else, or it would be too strong. :)","replies":[{"poster":"kirchhoff","date":"2015-10-20T21:13:00.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=istenszek,realm=EUW,application-id=cAOZwaUi,discussion-id=yrZA3nn4,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-20T15:44:30.298+0000)\n>\n> Anyone else feel like {{champion:8}} Vladimir needs a little buff?\n\nNO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vileblood Pyke","date":"2015-10-21T11:40:48.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Vladimir doesn't need a buff.\n2) Vladimir isn't a vampire. he's a hemomancer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Re delle Anime","date":"2015-10-20T16:47:14.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD vladimir merita un buff con tutto quel sustain fa 1vs2","replies":[]}]}
