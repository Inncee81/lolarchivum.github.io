But ey, if you guys wanna try this at home, make sure not to buy relic as first item! Go for machete first and then Relic. I like that idea of building relic into taragon as jungler a lot. \r\nYou have so many benefits, here are some:\r\n\r\nYou pay 350 gold and in about 7~8 minutes you will get it back and even have more then you have spent \r\n\r\nYou can actually build red/blue smite and still have the warding option, which is really really good.\r\n\r\nThe quest  is now 500 gold, 250 gold cheaper than last patch, and the relic shield line was not made more difficult to complete while killing the jungle.\r\n\r\nAlso you can tax lanes without getting flamed by the laners, complaining about taking Gold away from them.ï»¿","replies":[{"poster":"Frattaglia","date":"2018-01-25T17:49:32.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi dude, the relic idea may be nice, but we are on the Italian board and we would like only italian thread.\nSorry but I have to close the thread.\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"MisogiKumagawa","date":"2018-01-25T18:43:22.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frattaglia bannalo pls,Ã¨ quello che prima usava google trnaslate con un altro account","replies":[]}]}]}
