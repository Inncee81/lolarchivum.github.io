Today im bringing you an exclusive video, that is educational and i hope you can learn and take something out of it.\r\n\r\nI have picked that game because i did some good decision and \r\ndecision making is really important and helps you to climb the ladder.\r\n\r\nMany people complain about their team feeding and that would be the reason why they cant climb. Im gonna show you the exact opposite, that when you stay calmed and do the right decisions you can also carry a lost game. In this game my lanes fed hard and we lost a lot of turrets but still, i manage to carry them.","replies":[]}
