Im here because I have a problem I think it&#039;s weird. \nAbout 2 weeks ago I had a lose streak and I got demoted from gold 3 to gold 5 and I got stuck there,\nI started trying to improve, in few words I changed \ncompletely my play style.\nI was a very aggressive player, tho I always had lots of kill, I died a lot, I never ward when I play mid and push like retard, etc..\nNow I have more map awareness, I can ward Better, I die   less, I have more objective control etc\nThis is when the strange thing happened, I get less lp than before (14 win, 23 lose)tho I think I&#039;m playing pretty much better than before, so I just don&#039;t get it.\nGetting less lp means I have a lower mmr, what should I do?\nIs it because the play style change? \n\nMikcyi\n\nI&#039;m  Gold 4 now","replies":[{"poster":"TORREro064","date":"2015-12-30T12:57:30.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG siete diventati tutti inglesi!!!\nio sono legno 5 in inglese.

If you think u are going well, just win some games and riot will give you some lp more. Look at me: when i were silver, riot give me 14 lp for win and 23 for defeat, like you.\nNow i am b3, but i'm having a good win streak and give me 20/23 lp for win and 15/20 lp for defeat.\nJust try to win.\nDid u think u help your team? Do u ward? Do u do some roam when u take an advantage on your opponent? **Do u take some turret for your team** (this is very important)**?** and do u do good calls? If you do tose thigs, u will win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YY 1314520","date":"2016-01-04T17:07:43.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"L'inglese si impara giocando a lol, come ho fatto io hue hue hue :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daniele646","date":"2015-12-30T14:56:25.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro quest is de italian forum post your problem in de forum ov ur ling","replies":[]}]}
